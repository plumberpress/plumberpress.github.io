<p>Inspect the washer for wear or fractures when you remove the cap to flush out the valve. Changing a bad washer is cheap and easy. But finding the right washer may not be. The most common washers are often offered at home centers and hardware shops. Other designs can be hard to discover. If you choose to hunt for a washer, eliminate it and take it to the shop to find a match. Plumbers normally replace the entire fill valve instead of hunt for a replacement washer.</p>
<p>But is a plumbing catastrophe impending or simply an issue for the long run? Changing old pipes in a 1,500 square foot, two-bathroom home expenses $4,000 to $10,000, and requires cutting open walls and floors, so you definitely do not want to get the job done before it's necessary.
