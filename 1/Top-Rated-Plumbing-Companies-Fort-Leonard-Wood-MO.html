<p>Your kitchen sink is an integral part of your house, that makes its plumbing's effective functioning a need more than a need.

<p>A license is also needed to reconnect electrical or gas service to a residence. If the energy has been shut off to a residential structure for 6 consecutive months, reconnect authorizations are needed.
