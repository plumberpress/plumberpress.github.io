<p>Water softeners leakages are mainly caused because of an issue at the point of installation or since of maintenance. When setting up the plumbing to your softener, take your time and ensure your fittings are threaded well and your push-to-connect fittings are seated correctly. If the bypass valve is split, it can likewise trigger the system to leak. Bypass valves are fitted with -rings that might need to be re-lubricated or changed in time. A broken rotor valve or rotor valve seal may also be the offender. The rotor valve directs the water throughout the system during softening and regeneration processes. A worn water valve can lock up and spring a leak. If the rotor valve's seal is leaking, it is likely broken and simply needs to be replaced.</p>
