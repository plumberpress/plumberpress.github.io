<h3>Plumbing And Water Heater Repair Lyons IL</h3>
<p>Iron or manganese fouling: Iron or manganese that has been exposed to air or chlorine can clog the resin and avoid it from working. This is referred to as fouling. Sometimes it may be necessary to filter the water before it gets to your softener to prevent fouling. If the resin ends up being fouled, commercial cleaners are available. Cleaners need to be utilized according to producer directions to prevent contamination.</p>
<p>Water softening describes the removal of magnesium, calcium, and other minerals from water. The most popular technique of water softening is through a process called ion exchange. During ion exchange, mineral ions are traded for another kind of ion-- normally salt. The result is water that's been successfully softened by removing nearly all traces of the minerals that make up hard water.</p>

<p>How does ion exchange work? A physical and chemical  process filters the water through an exchange media referred to as resin or zeolite. Typically, the resin is a natural or artificial, sand-like material coated with positively charged sodium ions.
