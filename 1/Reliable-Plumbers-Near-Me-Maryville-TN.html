<p>The most basic mechanical backflow prevention device is the vacuum breaker assembly (VBA). It has one moving part, a portable disc connected to a climatic vent. In case of a siphon, the pressure in the valve will drop below that of the outside air. This activates the disc to open, allowing air to bring back and get in the valve pressure comparable to ambient climatic standard. This restoration of pressure breaks the siphon and prevents cross contamination.</p>
