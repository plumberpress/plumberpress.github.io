<p>Many homes or buildings that were constructed in the 1970s generally have galvanized piping. In time, the plumbing system can wear and the pipes can begin to rust. This can trigger low water pressure and impact the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping includes iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to offer weather condition protection. As the outer finishing of zinc begins to erode, the pipe is exposed to water and wetness, triggering the iron to eventually rust.</p>
