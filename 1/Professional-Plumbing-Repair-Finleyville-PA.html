<p>Soft water is safe to drink. During the ion exchange process, the resin beads do release salt into the water when getting ahold of the hardness minerals. But the amount of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and really is far less than what is commonly envisioned. If you have moderately tough water, for example five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just adding 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested daily salt intake. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the amount of sodium included by water softeners is minimal.</p>
