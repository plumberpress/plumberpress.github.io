<p>Foul Sewer Smell: Among the very first most apparent signs of a sewer problem is an odor of sewage when you flush the toilet, or in the backyard (in the area where your sewer line would be).

<p>Take an example: State the your heater is 8 years old and you need to work with a plumber for that burner set. The total repair bill might remain in the $300 variety. A gas hot water heater (not counting miscellaneous plumbing parts) costs $400 to $1200 (electric hot water heater cost about $400 to $800). That repair bill is nearly half the cost of the heater itself, and it's an old heater on its last legs anyhow. Go for the brand-new heater.</p>
