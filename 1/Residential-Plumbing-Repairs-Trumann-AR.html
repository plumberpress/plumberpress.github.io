This can cause low water pressure and impact the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping consists of iron pipes that have actually been coded with zinc to provide weather condition security. As the outer covering of zinc starts to deteriorate, the pipe is exposed to water and wetness, triggering the iron to eventually rust.</p>
