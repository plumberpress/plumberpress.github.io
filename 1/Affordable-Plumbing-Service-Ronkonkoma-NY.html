If the component is not repaired properly, the guide might limit the motion (instead of direct or stable) of the element, which could cause the component to not work to its abilities. Lot of times springs are incorrectly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In many cases the guides are limiting the travel of the part causing lower test results than what is required.</p>
