<p>The majority of homes or structures that were constructed in the 1970s generally have galvanized piping. With time, the plumbing system can wear out and the pipes can start to corrode. This can cause low water pressure and impact the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping includes iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to supply weather condition protection. As the external covering of zinc begins to wear down, the pipe is exposed to water and moisture, triggering the iron to ultimately rust.</p>
