In these programs, older 3.5 and 6.0 - gallons per flush toilet components in residences were replaced with 1.6 - gallons per flush designs. Continuous blockages: If the plunger has actually become a routine fixture in your bathroom, it's time for a replacement. Continuous blockages show your toilet no longer has the power required to efficiently eliminate waste with each flush.</p>
<p>Do yourself a favor and buy a versatile supply of water line. They're a lot easier to install than stiff metal or plastic tubing. Make sure to get one that's covered with stainless-steel mesh. For a good seal, hold the hose so it intends straight into the shutoff or fill valve while you're screwing on the connectors. Make them handtight, then add another quarter turn with pliers. Links that are too tight can really trigger leakages or spin the fill valve inside the tank. If needed, check for leakages and tighten them a bit more.</p>
