<p>Pools of septic waste. If you can see sewage pooling in your backyard, one of the more apparent outdoor signs is. The problem might be a cracked main sewer line if your yard smells foul and there's a puddle that just will not go away. The waste disposal unit is leaking: This is triggered by a damaged hose or seal. We'll completely examine your system to find the problem and carry out the needed repair.</p>

<p>Pro Idea: If you're going to be draining pipes a dishwasher through the system, now is the very best time to remove the knockout plug inside the dishwasher inlet.

This is also the ideal time to make the connections for a hardwired system with a pre-existing junction box.</p>
