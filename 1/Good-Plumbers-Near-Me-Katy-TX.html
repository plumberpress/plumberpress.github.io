<p>In order to repipe your home, Cabrillo will need to get rid of little sections of your drywall so we can access and replace your pipes. Depending upon the size of your house, this procedure will likely take a few days to a week to finish. Don't stress, while we're dealing with your home we'll cover all of your furnishings, floors and other possessions so that our work doesn't make a mess. After the whole procedure is completed and your home is cleaned up, we'll test to ensure that water is flowing correctly through all of your new pipes.</p>
<p>Depending upon the size of your house, repiping might take anywhere from a couple of days to a week. Normally, it is possible to do the bulk of the work that needs complete water turned off while you are out and about throughout the day, so you experience very little disruption to your everyday routine. To start the repiping process, the plumbing team will initially cover any carpet and furniture to secure them from dust and debris. They will then make small cuts in the wall and drywall to locate the pipes and after that eliminate and replace them, leaving as much of the original building material as possible undamaged.</p>
