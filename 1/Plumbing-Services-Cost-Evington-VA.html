New assemblies must be checked by a State of Washington certified Backflow Assembly Tester prior to taking into service. A copy of the test report must be supplied to the City of Bellingham. Your water will taste much better. The minerals in hard water can trigger a bad odor and taste. It gets rid of the mineral content to produce odorless drinking water that tastes great when you add a water softener.</p>

<p>How does ion exchange work? A chemical and physical procedure filters the water through an exchange media referred to as resin or zeolite. Generally, the resin is a natural or synthetic, sand-like material covered with positively charged sodium ions. As the calcium and magnesium dissolves into positively charged ions, an ion exchange environment is created. The water streams through the system while the resin releases its salt ions and readily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water flowing out of the device is now considered soft.</p>
<p>Hot water heater service is frequently overlooked, but your water heater is one of the most essential pieces of innovation in your house. The right hot water heater can keep your baths and showers comfortable, your dishes clean, and your clothing washed-- all at a temperature that works best for the soaps you're utilizing. Shut off the water at the valves under the sink, and turn on the faucet to permit the water to drain. Make certain the drains are plugged to avoid little parts from falling in.</p>
