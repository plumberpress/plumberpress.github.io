<p>Find the ideal water softener for you. One typical way for a house's water supply to be polluted is if the irrigation water lines, which could become tainted by pesticides or weed toxin, backflow into the interior water lines. If that contaminated water were to backflow into the community drinking supply, the issue could spread out tremendously. A backflow preventer not just protects drinking water in specific homes, it also avoids wastewater in private houses from flowing back out and infecting the general public supply of water.</p>
<p>Another responsibility of the Plumbing Division is to carry out cross connection inspections to determine potable water supply that are in need of being protected from contaminates. The cross connection control program is needed by the State of Michigan's Safe Drinking Water Act 1976 PA 399. A-Tex Plumbing will help with any kind of emergency toilet repair, drain cleaning or replacement that you might need in your home or workplace.</p>
