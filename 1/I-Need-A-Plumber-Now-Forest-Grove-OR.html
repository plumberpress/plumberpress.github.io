<h3>The Many Services Provided By Residential Plumbers Forest Grove OR</h3>
<p>A. Typically wax does not "go bad" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to prevent odors. If you are experiencing a leak coming from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or full blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Also, ensure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" undetected problem. Attempt putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>Examine the disposal. Turn the power back on, run water into the sink and turn on the disposal to make sure it works. Check beneath to be sure there aren't any leaks. Run some food through the disposal to be sure it grinds and gets disposed of properly. Pipes made from galvanized steel are no longer utilized in brand-new houses, but many houses built between the 1930s - 1980s still have them. When discovered and replaced with another pipe product, galvanized steel pipes need to be gotten rid of by a professional plumber.</p>
