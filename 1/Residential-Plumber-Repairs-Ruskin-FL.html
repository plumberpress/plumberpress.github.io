<p>Soft water is safe to consume. Throughout the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do launch salt into the water when grabbing ahold of the firmness minerals. However the quantity of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and in fact is far less than what is commonly imagined. If you have moderately tough water, for example five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only adding 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested daily salt intake. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the amount of sodium added by water softeners is minimal.</p>
