<p>City of Bellingham inspects backflow assemblies upon installation and carries out routine re-inspections on all existing assemblies. New assemblies should be tested by a State of Washington certified Backflow Assembly Tester prior to taking into service. A copy of the test report need to be offered to the City of Bellingham.

Any backflow preventer set up on a water fountain or garden pond need to be tested upon installation and then annually.</p>
<p>Clearly the resin is not an inexhaustible exchange site. When all the salt exchange sites are replaced with firmness minerals, the resin is invested and will no longer soften water. At this point, the water softener will need to be run on an alternate cycle called regrowth. Throughout this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt solution. The salt water is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had actually been adsorbed on the resin. The softener can be returned to use as soon as backwashing is total. Some water softeners will immediately switch to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 shows both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regrowth.</p>
