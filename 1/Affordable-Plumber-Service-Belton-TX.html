<p>Pre-action sprinkler systems usually are set up in areas where water might trigger devastating damage, such as in freezers, computer system spaces, and locations with electronic equipment. The piping in a pre-action system consists of air or nitrogen, which can be pressurized or non-pressurized. Water to the system is kept back by the pre-action valve, which is connected to a fire detection system. If a fire takes place, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the pre-action valve, which then allows water into the system's piping. The water is discharged through the open sprinkler.</p>

If your energy costs are rising, a brand-new, greater performance hot water heater can bring them pull back. All that needs to be done is blocking the inlet and outlet valves of the softener and open up the bypass valve, enabling difficult water to flow to the storage tank and household taps.
