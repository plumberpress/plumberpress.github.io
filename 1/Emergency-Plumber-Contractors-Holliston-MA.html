<p>Pre-action lawn sprinkler generally are set up in locations where water might trigger devastating damage, such as in freezers, computer system spaces, and locations with electronic equipment. The piping in a pre-action system contains air or nitrogen, which can be pressurized or non-pressurized. Water to the system is kept back by the pre-action valve, which is connected to a fire detection system.
