<p>The issue of leak can be credited to any variety of elements which can range from the tank is old and worn, to over-pressurization, as well as poor maintenance. When heating the water, the water heater tank need to have some room to account for the expansion that takes place. The thermal growth needs to get away, hence the need for a growth tank to help control the pressure. The force put in by the expansion taking place when boiling the water triggers the reservoir to break and start leaking if the tank is old and used out. The remedy for this is to replace the water heater unit.</p>
