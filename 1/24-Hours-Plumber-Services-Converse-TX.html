But the quantity of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and actually is far less than what is widely imagined. If you have reasonably tough water, for example five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just adding 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested daily salt consumption. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams.
