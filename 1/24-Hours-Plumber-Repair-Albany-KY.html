<p>When you remove the cap to flush out the valve, inspect the washer for wear or fractures. Replacing a bad washer is inexpensive and easy. But finding the right washer may not be. The most typical washers are frequently offered at home centers and hardware shops. Other styles can be tough to find. If you choose to hunt for a washer, remove it and take it to the store to discover a match. Plumbers generally replace the entire fill valve rather than hunt for a replacement washer.</p>
