<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>Your sewer line is one of the most essential parts of your household plumbing - and if it ends up being clogged or broken, it could wreak undesirable problems on your home. A home's service line (likewise called a sewer lateral) runs from your house to the mainline sewer in the street. In many cases, the property owner is accountable for keeping the service line from the house to the curb, and the City is responsible for keeping the mainline sewer and the part of the service line from the mainline sewer to the curb.</p>
<p>To connect a power cord to the new system, get rid of the electrical cover plate on the bottom of the disposer and sign up with the colored wires discovered inside with their equivalents in the cable, using wire nuts. The green ground wire is looped under the green screw on the system. This can be done at any point prior to installation. Plumbing plans are not required for one- and two-family houses or townhouses, as defined in the California Residential Code, and their accessory structures.</p>
