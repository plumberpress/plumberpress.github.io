<p>As soon as a big sufficient source of water has actually been recognized and assessed, the third major part of a supply of water system enters play: a system of pipelines to communicate the water from its source to its consumers. The biggest of these main long-distance transmitting pipes are referred to as aqueducts. Normally built of large-diameter (10 feet or more) enhanced concrete pipe sectors, and even tunnels lined with an impermeable finish, these are big underground and aboveground pipes designed to bring bulk flow quantities of water to treatment plants, secondary storage centers and distribution nodes where the circulations are moved to smaller-sized branch circulation pipelines.

And these differences dictate the possible need for backflow preventers.</p>
<p>Most backflow preventers are developed to permit the components to be removed for repair while the main body remains installed in the piping system.

Understanding the correct order for disassembly of the backflow preventer can be essential.</p>
