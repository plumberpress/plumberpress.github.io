<p>Milwaukee, WI - Oct. 12, 2017 - SofTap Water, Inc., a Cincinnati water technology start-up, and a graduate of The Water Council's BREW Corporate Accelerator program in Milwaukee WI, announced today they have accomplished a breakthrough in water softening treatment utilizing a proprietary Surface Accelerated Condensation (SACr) technology. SACr physically eliminates temporary firmness without utilizing chemicals or high pressure, which are significant constraints of existing softening innovations.</p>
<p>Depending upon the level of the clog, we might utilize a range of various techniques, the most typical being hydro-jetting. Hydro-jetting is an innovative type of drain cleaning where we utilize water under high pressure to entirely clean out whatever inside your drains. Lay the garbage disposal on its side and get rid of the electrical cover plate from the bottom. Loosen the green ground screw and get rid of wire ports. Detach waste disposal unit wires from electrical supply wires. Loosen up screws on the electrical clamp connector and eliminate wires from the garbage disposal.</p>

Most plumbers are extremely experienced with these common plumbing jobs around the home.</p>
