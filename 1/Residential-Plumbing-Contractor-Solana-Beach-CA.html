The most common way a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool referred to as a plumber's drain, cable television or snake auger. The tool is thoroughly inserted down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can attempt to do this yourself, however this isn't a beginner's DIY task. If you use the tool incorrectly, you can damage your pipes and cause other leakages - so it's worth it to call somebody who understands the drill.</p>
