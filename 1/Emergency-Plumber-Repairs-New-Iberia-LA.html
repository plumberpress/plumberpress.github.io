<p>The new inlets and outlets on the tank do not constantly line up with the old supply lines. Solder in a set of 45-degree fittings to offset each line if necessary. Likewise replace the old shutoff valve with a brand-new ball valve while you're at it (Picture 6). Vent diameters are sized according to the heat output of the water heater. You may need to increase or reduce the vent size to ensure the best draft. CARE: If you're unsure if your chimney has a liner, ask your plumbing inspector.</p>
