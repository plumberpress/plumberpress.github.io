<p>Backpressure backflow in a structure results when the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the incoming safe and clean water supply. Backpressure can be triggered by pumps or temperature level increases in boilers, or if there is a reduction in the water supply pressure. Backsiphonage takes place when unfavorable or decreased pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, typically due to a disruption or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or nearby firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A typical type of backflow preventer is the lowered pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>

<p>Metal alloys are susceptible to an electro-chemical condition called rust. Rust can literally consume a metal away triggering the metal to not be as strong as it originally was or modify the tolerances triggering parts to not operate in a backflow preventer. If the part is functional or should be changed, the impact of deterioration on a metal alloy must be examined to identify.</p>
<p>The appropriate repair of a backflow preventer requires many products to be evaluated. The hydraulic conditions present at the backflow prevention assembly need to be assessed. The installation must be evaluated to guarantee it does not prevent the workings of the assembly. Test information should be accumulated to figure out the operations of each element. The backflow prevention assembly must be taken apart and parts replaced with initial factory parts. The backflow prevention assembly should be checked once again to be sure it was correctly fixed. Comparing the test results from the repaired backflow prevention assembly to the makers flowchart is needed to ensure it was fixed correctly. An effectively fixed assembly must supply years of security.</p>
