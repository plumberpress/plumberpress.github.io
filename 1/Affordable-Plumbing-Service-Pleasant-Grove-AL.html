When these elements are not the cause of the unacceptable water softening, it might be time to replace the softener resin, or maybe even the entire softener. Cation exchange water softeners eliminate the calcium and magnesium ions found in difficult water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. When all the ions are fully exchanged, the water softener goes through a regrowth procedure to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with new salt ions.</p>
