If you are experiencing a leak originating from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or full blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Likewise, make sure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" undiscovered issue. If you aren't sure where the leak is coming from, try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours.</p>

<p>A toilet auger works the opposite way that a plunger does. Rather than dislodging the blockage with unfavorable pressure, it in fact pushes into the blockage, working even more into where the obstruction is happening. The auger or snake" is then used to push the clog out of the drain pipe, leaving a clear path for water to stream freely. The auger's corkscrew-shaped tip helps force it even more down into the clog, making it simpler to clear.</p>
<p>Before installing, your professional will shut off water and electrical power to the area. Next, the old sink flange is removed and cleaned of any putty residue. Then, a new installing ring is set up to the bottom of the sink, the sink drain is linked, and the disposal is hooked up to its mount. In this approach, water is treated with a calculated quantity of washing soda (Na2CO3) which converts the chlorides and sulphates of calcium and magnesium into their respective carbonates which get sped up.</p>
