<h3>Water Leak Detection Tips for Homes in Pikeville KY 41501</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Instead of a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to deal with peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively adjust to your company' circulation rates throughout the day. During periods of high circulation demand, tanks come on-line to add flow rate capability. During durations of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new approach to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation technology, and it's perhaps the most crucial innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
