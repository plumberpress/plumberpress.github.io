<p>Minerals in water are what makes certain water thought about hard." Calcium and magnesium are the most common minerals discovered in water. Usually, minerals get there because groundwater will liquify rock like limestone, or metals, like iron and the remnants travel with the water up until it is in your house. Water softening uses an ion exchange process to get rid of dissolved minerals that aren't as efficiently removed by mechanical filtration. These products are what causes hard water.</p>

Water in a gas pipe is likely from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water content of LP or natural gas is very low.

Therefore when vaporized water ultimately falls as rain - it is soft.</p>
