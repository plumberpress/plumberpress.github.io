Rather than a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to handle peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to effectively get used to your company' flow rates throughout the day. During durations of high circulation demand, tanks come on-line to include flow rate capability. During durations of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This new method to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation technology, and it's perhaps the most crucial innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
