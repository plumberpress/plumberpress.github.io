<p>Looking for reliable, cost-effective solutions to damaged pipes? Call (979) 200-6674 to find out how your local Brenham repiping professionals can assist. If you have actually been observing a musty odor developing in the cabinets under the sink, you might have a leak someplace. It might be the drain, the faucet, and even the supply hose. Since they are relatively easy to pinpoint, switch on the water and get snooping under your sink.</p>
<p>The flywheel is jammed: If the disposal hums when you turn the switch, but it does not grind up food, this suggests the flywheel is stuck. Try freeing the jam by placing a hex wrench of the correct size into the hole on the bottom of the waste disposal unit. Alternately, you can prod the flywheel by sticking a broom handle (not your fingers!) into the sink.</p>

It's time to call in a professional if your disposal begins making loud sounds or does not work at all. Never ever put yourself at risk of injury by putting your hand in the drain. We have the training and tools to repair or replace the disposal the proper way. We'll identify the issue and quickly fix it so you can have a working disposal prior to your next meal.</p>
