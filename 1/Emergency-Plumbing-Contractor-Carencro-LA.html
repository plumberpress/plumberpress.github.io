<p>Plastic pipe remains in wide use for domestic water system and drain-waste-vent (DWV) pipe. Principal types include: Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) was produced experimentally in the 19th century but did not become useful to manufacture until 1926, when Waldo Semon of BF Goodrich Co. developed a method to plasticize PVC, making it easier to process. PVC pipe started to be produced in the 1940s and was in large usage for Drain-Waste-Vent piping throughout the restoration of Germany and Japan following WWII. In the 1950s, plastics manufacturers in Western Europe and Japan started producing acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) pipe. The method for producing cross-linked polyethylene (PEX) was also established in the 1950s. Plastic supply pipes have ended up being significantly typical, with a variety of fittings and materials used.</p>
<p>The typical service is to have the defective pipes changed when you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes replaced, which is where whole-house repiping is available in. This is an option to think about if you live in an older home - such as one constructed pre-1970 - or any home with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular option for house plumbing for many decades, but steel eventually suffers from rust and lacks the durability of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
