Plumber's putty can not be utilized on certain brand-new sinks, but these will be labeled to that effect. If you can't utilize plumber's putty, use a non-water-based silicone.

<p>Backpressure backflow in a building results when the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the inbound safe and clean water system. Backpressure can be caused by pumps or temperature increases in boilers, or if there is a reduction in the water system pressure. Backsiphonage occurs when negative or lower pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, generally due to a disturbance or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or close-by firefighting activity. To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A common type of backflow preventer is the lowered pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
