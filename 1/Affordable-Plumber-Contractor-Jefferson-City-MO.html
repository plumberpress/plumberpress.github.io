<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, but he charged $300 plus tax. Rather of fixing the leak, he wished to replace the entire piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he could not simply fix the fittings instead of a total replace. He said he would change the washers which may do it. He then disconnected the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted no more repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there given that it wasn't on a load. As quickly as he left, my occupants attempted the sink and it was still leaking. Due to the fact that he had another appointment, they called him back and he stated he would not come back.
