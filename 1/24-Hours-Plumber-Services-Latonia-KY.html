For example, if you have a 2 piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your very first line of defense against leaks in between the tank and bowl. As it gets used, it can start to harden and crack or merely be so crushed that it does not fill the space as well as it utilized to, and you wind up with water all over the location. Similar to with the gasket, in some cases your tank to bowl washers and bolts can end up being so used or rusty that they spring a leak. Whenever you replace your flush valve, we strongly advise also changing your gasket and your bolt set to make certain whatever is in good shape.</p>
