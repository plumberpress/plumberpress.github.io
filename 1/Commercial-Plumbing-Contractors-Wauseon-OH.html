<p>Do yourself a favor and purchase a versatile water system line. They're a lot easier to install than stiff metal or plastic tubing. Make sure to get one that's covered with stainless steel mesh. For an excellent seal, hold the hose so it aims directly into the shutoff or fill valve while you're screwing on the adapters. Make them handtight, then add another quarter turn with pliers. Links that are too tight can in fact trigger leaks or spin the fill valve inside the tank. Look for leakages and tighten them a bit more if required.</p>
