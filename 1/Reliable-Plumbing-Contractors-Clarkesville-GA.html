<h3>Plumbing Company Serving Clarkesville GA</h3>
<p>Though water line replacement seems like your house's equivalent of major surgical treatment, it's in fact something we at Gotelli Plumbing handle frequently. When your water lines are repiped, it simply implies old copper and galvanized pipes are replaced with new pipes. We discover that houses 15 years or older who have actually never had repiping work are the most likely prospects for water line replacement. If you have an older house and are experiencing regular and major leaks, you might be in need of water line repiping. We discover that repiping can actually be the less expensive and much better long-term option if you do have frequent leakages.</p>
<p>Soft water is safe to drink. Throughout the ion exchange process, the resin beads do launch sodium into the water when grabbing ahold of the firmness minerals. However the amount of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and really is far less than what is commonly envisioned. If you have moderately hard water, for instance five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only adding 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested everyday salt intake. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the quantity of salt included by water softeners is minimal.</p>
