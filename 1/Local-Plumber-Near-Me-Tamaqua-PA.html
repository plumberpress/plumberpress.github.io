<h3>The Importance Of Plumbers And Plumbing Services Tamaqua PA</h3>
<p>A. Generally wax does not "spoil" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to avoid smells. If you are experiencing a leak coming from below the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or complete blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Also, ensure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" undetected problem. Attempt putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>If the water heater is leaking from the bottom of the tank, that is an indication the tank is failing and will need to be changed. If it is in a garage and a small sluggish leak, schedule a quote as soon as possible and make sure absolutely nothing is near the heater that might be possibly harmed. Leaking water heaters can burst triggering water damage and flooding of houses.</p>
