<p>Remove the old putty with a plastic putty knife so you do not scratch the sink. Seal the brand-new basket in the sink with plumber's putty as displayed in Photo 4. Plumber's putty can not be used on specific brand-new sinks, however these will be labeled to that result. If you can't use plumber's putty, use a non-water-based silicone. When you tighten the locknut in place, excess putty will squeeze out in between the new basket strainer and the sink. Clean it off with a rag or paper towel.
