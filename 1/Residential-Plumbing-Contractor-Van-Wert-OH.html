<p>When the hardware parts have been cleaned up and inspected and the rubber parts have been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their components. Some components may have extremely tight tolerances that need to be maintained. An important thing to identify on each element is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the movement of the component. The guide is a really vital part of the design of each part. If the component is not fixed effectively, the guide could restrict the motion (instead of consistent or direct) of the component, which might cause the element to not work to its capabilities. Often times springs are erroneously blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. For the most part the guides are restricting the travel of the part triggering lower test results than what is required.</p>
<p>The connections of kitchen sink faucets are another common leak-prone area. These can likewise be tough to repair as they are typically situated behind the sink, in cramped areas.
