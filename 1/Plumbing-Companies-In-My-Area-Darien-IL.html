<p>Professional drain cleaning and plumbing blockage service may appear like a waste of cash. Why purchase professional drain repair service when a chemical drain cleaner will do the trick? While chemical drain cleaners may be an economical option, the severe ingredients rust your inner drain pipe, over time, creating weak spots in the pipe that are likely to burst. Dealing with fixing a burst pipe is definitely not worth the cost savings incurred from using a chemical drain cleaner.</p>
<p>The discharge tube included in the disposer kit will be connected to the disposer using the plate, gasket and screws originally planned for the disposer discharge elbow. If your set just includes a waste arm, it is possible - though not suggested - to connect this to the disposer discharge elbow utilizing a slip joint. The successive 90 ° turns in such a setup can cause incorrect drainage. Depending upon the length of the waste arm, you might have the ability to cut off its elbow and utilize the rest as a straight discharge tube.</p>
