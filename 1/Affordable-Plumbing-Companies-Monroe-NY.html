These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is causing a clog, which can vary from the typical suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, small objects, dirt, and even roots in cases where broken pipes on your home draw the attention of plant life.

<p>If there are any lead pipes in the home, find out. Houses that were built prior to 1986 often have lead or galvanized plumbing. Lead, as you understand, no matter how beneficial, is an ecological toxin (note the need for unleaded fuel and paint in houses that is not lead based). You might not desire to live in a house that has lead pipes if you have kids.</p>
<p>Broken pipes end up being incredibly more pricey to fix as the rate of the circulation of the broken pipe grows. And whether commercial or residential, broken pipes can cause leakage into the water supply, which can be a significant cause of issue and even an environmental hazard if a sewage line is included.
