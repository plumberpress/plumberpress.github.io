<p>At Gary's Plumbing and Heating, we service all your water heating problems. The Minor Label Program is an alternative inspection program developed by the Oregon Modified Statutes (ORS). The program utilizes minor installation labels and random inspections instead of routine electrical and plumbing licenses for particular kinds of small electrical and plumbing work.

Please trim your plants and arrange for testing with a company from our certified tester list This need to be completed within one month to avoid water service interruption.</p>
<p>Light Blue = Reduced Pressure Zone - supply pressure pushes open the # 1 check and is reduced by the # 1 Inspect spring (for instance, to 90 psi). This pressure distinction throughout the # 1 check valve maintains the relief valve in the closed position. If pressure in the Zone rises toward the supply pressure (within 2 to 3 psi), the Relief Valve discharges, preventing backflow (reverse movement of fluid).</p>

<p>The simplest mechanical backflow prevention device is the vacuum breaker assembly (VBA). It has one moving part, a portable disc attached to a climatic vent. In the event of a siphon, the pressure in the valve will drop listed below that of the outside air. This triggers the disc to open, allowing air to go into the valve and bring back pressure comparable to ambient atmospheric requirement. This remediation of pressure breaks the siphon and avoids cross contamination.</p>
