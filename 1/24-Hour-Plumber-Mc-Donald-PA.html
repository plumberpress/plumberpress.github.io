To safeguard water quality, backflow protection is needed where completion user presents a threat of polluting the city's supply of water.</p>
<p>As soon as a large adequate source of water has been identified and evaluated, the 3rd major element of a supply of water system comes into play: a system of pipelines to convey the water from its source to its customers. The largest of these primary long-distance transferring pipes are described as aqueducts. Generally constructed of large-diameter (10 feet or more) strengthened concrete pipe sectors, and even tunnels lined with an impermeable finish, these are substantial underground and aboveground pipes created to bring bulk flow amounts of water to treatment plants, secondary storage centers and circulation nodes where the flows are transferred to smaller-sized branch distribution pipelines. Many big cities need a number of aqueducts providing water from varied and geographically separated sources.</p>
