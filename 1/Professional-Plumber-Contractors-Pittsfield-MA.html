<p>Please let EBMUD understand of any situation that might require a backflow device. Sometimes conditions on properties change that might require a backflow device, such as dealing with a boiler with ingredients or setting up a well with a pump. Sewer repairs are more than a hassle for your business, they can cause financial losses and in some circumstances can stop your business completely.
