<h3>Professional Experience Is Essential For A Good Plumber Vancouver WA</h3>
<p>A. Generally wax does not "go bad" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to prevent odors. If you are experiencing a leak originating from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or complete blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Likewise, make certain the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" undiscovered issue. If you aren't sure where the leak is coming from, try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours.</p>
<p>On average, the cost to replace a toilet varies in between $ 122 and $228, with most homeowners investing around $ 150 to $180. This does not consist of the cost of the toilet, which averages $ 99 to $199, for an overall toilet replacement cost of $ 221 to $427. A high-efficiency toilet with additional features can cost $ 800 to $1,500 to install. The typical installation takes a plumber 2 to 4 hours at $ 65 per hour. If you're changing an existing toilet, add $ 30 to $50 to eliminate your old toilet.</p>
