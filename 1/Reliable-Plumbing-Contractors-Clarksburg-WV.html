<p>Do yourself a favor and purchase a flexible water supply line. They're a lot easier to install than stiff metal or plastic tubing. Make sure to get one that's covered with stainless-steel mesh. For a great seal, hold the hose so it aims directly into the shutoff or fill valve while you're screwing on the adapters. Make them handtight, then add another quarter turn with pliers. Links that are too tight can really cause leakages or spin the fill valve inside the tank. If needed, examine for leakages and tighten them a bit more.</p>

Instead of a switch, the batch feed garbage disposal is triggered by putting a stopper in the sink drain.</p>
<p>All you really need to do is (THOROUGHLY!) once you've found the trip lever you want eliminate your tank lid, unhook the existing lever from the flapper, and unscrew it from the tank. Take your new trip lever, place it in the hole where your old trip lever was and secure it. Keep in mind that because of the way a lever works, the locknuts for a lot of toilet trip levers will be reverse threaded so make certain you're turning things the right way. When you've protected the journey lever and are all set to connect your flapper, make certain you've got just enough slack in the chain to guarantee the flapper is sealing firmly over the flush valve yet is still lifting all the method when you push down on the journey lever.</p>
