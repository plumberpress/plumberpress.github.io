<p>Backflow preventers are important for developing a safe water supply system. Stainless steel blades are usually preferred due to the fact that they're less susceptible to rust. Other great choices are overload protection, which shuts off the motor if it begins to overheat; an auto-reverse function to prevent jamming; and a dishwasher-drain connection so food particles from the unclean dishes get ground up in the disposal.
