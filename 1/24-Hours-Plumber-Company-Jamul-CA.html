<h3>Is Your Water Heater Leaking? Find Out What You Should Do in Jamul CA 91935</h3>
<p>Seattle Public Utilities examines backflow assemblies upon installation and carries out regular re-inspections on all existing assemblies. New assemblies need to be evaluated by a State of Washington certified backflow assembly tester prior to putting into service. A copy of the test report need to be provided to us.

The thermal expansion needs to escape, thus the need for an expansion tank to assist control the pressure. If the tank is old and worn out, the force applied by the expansion happening when boiling the water causes the reservoir to split and begin leaking.
