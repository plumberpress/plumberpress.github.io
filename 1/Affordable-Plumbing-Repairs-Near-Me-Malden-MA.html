<p>Scrape off the old putty with a plastic putty knife so you do not scratch the sink. Seal the new basket in the sink with plumber's putty as displayed in Image 4. Plumber's putty can not be utilized on certain brand-new sinks, however these will be identified to that effect. Utilize a non-water-based silicone if you can't use plumber's putty. When you tighten the locknut in location, excess putty will squeeze out between the brand-new basket strainer and the sink. Clean it off with a rag or paper towel. Make certain to place the cardboard friction ring between the rubber gasket and the locknut so the locknut spins freely, without catching on the gasket.</p>
