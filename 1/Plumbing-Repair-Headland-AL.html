<p>Foul Sewer Odor: Among the very first most apparent signs of a sewer problem is a smell of sewage when you flush the toilet, or in the backyard (in the area where your sewer line would be). This can be a simple issue such as a broken water seal, or it can show a larger issue such as a broken sewer pipe. Drain repairs can avoid severe damage to your home. Even if the problem originates with the municipal system, it's still wise to bring in the experts to restrict the damage to your house.</p>
<p>We've currently seen what these 2 terms have in common, so what's the distinction in between them? When it comes to the issue of tough water, a traditional water softener in fact gets rid of silica, calcium and magnesium ions, leaving it with little amounts of what is called short-lived hardness". The softener replaces these ions with salt through a process called ion exchange.</p>

<p>Changing your flapper may require somewhat various steps than we show (Photos 2 and 3). Your flapper may screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. If you have an uncommon flush valve, finding a replacement flapper might be the hardest part of the task. To find an appropriate replacement, switch off the water, take the old one with you to the house center or hardware shop. (Shut off the water before eliminating the flapper.) You might not find an identical match, however possibilities are you'll locate one of the same shape and diameter. If not, attempt a plumbing supply store (in the Telephone Directory under Plumbing Supplies") or search online.</p>
