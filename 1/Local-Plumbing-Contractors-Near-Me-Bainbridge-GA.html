<p>The anode rod in your water heater is developed to attract corrosion-causing elements in the water, helping to prevent the steel tank from rusting. The best method to prevent drain clogs is to enjoy what you flush.

An entire home water softener is the option to the scourge of water solidity.</p>
<p>Another drawback of water softening through ion exchange is the potential health threat for people on low sodium diets. Ion exchange increases the quantity of salt in water, in order to lower its mineral material. Usually, this process adds 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending on how hard the water was to start with. Harder water will result in more sodium, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this boost in salt is minor, but if you've been advised by a physician to follow a rigorous low salt diet plan this increase can pose problems.</p>
