Most of the times, the property owner is accountable for keeping the service line from the home to the curb, and the City is responsible for preserving the mainline sewer and the part of the service line from the mainline sewer to the curb.</p>
<p>Prior to choice and installation, refer to manufacturers literature for temperature varieties. All assemblies must be protected from freezing temperature levels and if installed where temperatures will reach 100 degrees F or above, a warm water type assembly should be utilized. Consult manufacturers specs for recommendations. When looking for plumbing services in the area, specify with your needs and ask candidates if they are licensed plumbers and if they have the sophisticated experience and licenses related to a plumbing contractor.</p>
