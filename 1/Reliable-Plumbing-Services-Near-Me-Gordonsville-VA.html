<p>Downsides to be aware of is that hybrid water heaters need to be installed in an area that stays between 40 to 90 degrees, or they will not work well. They need up to 7 feet of clearance from the floor to ceiling, since the heatpump is on top of the water heater. Also, hybrids need approximately 1,000 cubic feet of uncooled space to catch sufficient heat from the air, and a drain in close proximity to discharge the condensate.</p>
<p>Physical strength. Plumbers, steamfitters, and pipefitters must be able to lift and move heavy tools and materials. Idea: Place a heavy things such as the disposal itself in the sink to weigh down the flange and keep it from moving throughout installation. Loosen the clamp and remove the dishwasher drain hose from the disposal.
