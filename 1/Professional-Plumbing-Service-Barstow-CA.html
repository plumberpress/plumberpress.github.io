<p>Hard water is triggered by high levels of calcium and magnesium in the water. Water softeners deal with the water by using salt and ion-exchange resins to eliminate these minerals. When the water can be found in contact with the resins, the calcium and magnesium ions move out of the water and onto the active sites on the resin. Then they are changed in the solution by the salt ions.</p>
<p>There are two kinds of water softeners, a salt based water softener and a salt-free water softener Salt based water softeners will give you more of the slick" sensation in the shower and you will observe the soap developing more bubbles. Other advantages you will see consist of brighter colors in your clothes, minimized scale accumulation on your showers and softer skin.</p>
