If you see a leak, get it fixed as soon as you can. Connecting watering to fountains, pool and garden ponds forbade: State law and City ordinance hold that no irrigation system may be linked to a water fountain, swimming pool, or garden pond. These water functions may just be filled with drinkable water. Water which has gotten in an irrigation system is not safe and clean.</p>
