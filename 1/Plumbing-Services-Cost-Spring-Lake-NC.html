<p>Low Dangers: For low hazards including fire systems and irrigation systems, City of Bellingham accepts double check detector and double check valve assemblies, pressure vacuum breaker assemblies and atmospheric vacuum breakers as kinds of protection. Since July 1, 1999, the DPH requires an RPD on all lines that lead to a fire lawn sprinkler with siamese connections, other than existing systems that currently have a DCVA installed (Ct. Regs. § 19-13-38a( c)( I)).</p>

<p>Lastly, the most complicated and sophisticated backflow preventer is the reduced pressure zone device. This device consists of no less than 5 independently operating valves (2 check valves and a differential relief valve sealed off at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve functions as a back up system to the other 4. Throughout basic water flows at style pressure, the 2 check valves remain open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by particles or if siphonage occurs to the linked service pipeline. To avoid backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a advanced and reliable  (if costly) device is best utilized in important locations where cross contamination could be a direct threat to life and health.</p>
<p>Oregon state laws governing water supply require backflow prevention assemblies to be installed on water services where cross connections can not be eliminated. Backflow assemblies are needed to be set up on the water service connections to all fire sprinkler and landscape sprinkler systems. The law likewise needs backflow assemblies in commercial establishments such as hospitals and mortuaries, in addition to industrial centers.</p>
