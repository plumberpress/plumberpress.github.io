<p>Button Plumbing was great. They replaced my kitchen faucet and added 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had always dripped in the previous if I turned off the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The rate was quite sensible. I will absolutely utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was extremely delighted with their service.</p>
<p>Take an example: State the your heater is 8 years old and you have to hire a plumber for that burner set. The overall repair bill might be in the $300 variety. A gas hot water heater (not counting various plumbing parts) costs $400 to $1200 (electrical hot water heater cost about $400 to $800).
