<p>Leakages are sneaky. Over time, the resin beads in the water softener will end up being covered with calcium and magnesium ions, decreasing their capability to soften difficult water. Through a process called regeneration, water is immediately flushed through the water softener with a focused amount of regenerant. Now the resin beads pick up the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the firmness on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems include an entire home water filtration with its patented self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the liquified rock and dirt and sediment are sent down the drain. With the resin beads recharged," the water softener goes back to service, providing the whole home with clean, soft water.</p>
