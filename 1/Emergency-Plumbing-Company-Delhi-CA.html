<p>Button Plumbing was fantastic. They changed my kitchen faucet and included two new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly dripped in the past if I shut off the water under the sink. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were really friendly and got the work done rapidly. The rate was quite reasonable. I will definitely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was extremely delighted with their service.</p>
