<h3>When To Call A Plumber Theodore AL</h3>
<p>Organic debris, such as grease, hair, or food stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the cause of clogged drains. The most common method a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's cable, drain or snake auger. The tool is carefully inserted down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can attempt to do this yourself, but this isn't a newbie's Do It Yourself task. If you utilize the tool improperly, you can harm your pipes and cause other leakages - so it's worth it to call someone who understands the drill.</p>
