<p>In some communities, house water softeners drain to local wastewater treatment plants, which are not designed to get rid of chloride. The chloride travels through the treatment plant and winds up in our lakes and streams. In homes with personal wells and house softeners, chloride drains to the house's septic system and after that ends up in lakes and streams.</p>
<p>The real process of installing a disposal must be done with caution. There are dangers involved because you are dealing with blades, electricity, and water.

<p>Water pressure must be examined a minimum of once a year or whenever you have a plumber in your home. When we check out a physician, no matter the factor, they will always check a patient's high blood pressure. Water pressure must be treated similarly. A pressure-reducing device in appropriate working order is extremely essential to preserving a healthy water shipment system in your home. Water pressure should never go beyond 80 psi. Anything reading above 80 psi. is an indicator of a stopping working water pressure-reducing device and need to be resolved as quickly as possible. If you're unsure about your water pressure, we can visit your home and utilize a gauge to measure your inbound water pressure for you. Then we can discuss any alternatives that might be readily available to provide you peace of mind and make sure a healthy water system.</p>

<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, effective, and a great man. He told me precisely what to expect (cost, time, procedure) in advance and provided as promised. I will definitely utilize Clog Dawg once again. Installing a garbage disposal takes 2 to 3 hours with a typical per hour rate of $25 to $70. These rates remain in addition to the cost of the disposal unit. If your plumber has a minimum callout cost that is greater than the labor cost for the work, the overall you pay might be higher.</p>
