<p>Culpeper Home Services provides professional waste disposal unit solutions throughout Culpeper County. We will provide you with choices for repair or replacement and recommend the very best service depending on your specific requirements. For double-bowl sinks, the best way to go about things is to use a continuous waste disposer set consisting of a discharge tube, baffle tee, and tailpiece. Such kits direct both drains to a single trap. Depending on the location of the stub out, you'll need either an end outlet or center outlet package.</p>
<p>Mineral deposits get caught on the sides of a pipe and harden. With time, the deposits collect, till they form a bottleneck that makes it harder for water and waste to travel through your pipes. These deposits happen more often when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, due to the fact that the toilet does not have the power to blast the minerals far from the drain pipe. You might have your drain pipes professionally cleaned up if you want to make doubly sure your toilet is the problem prior to you replace it. If your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still obstructs, it's time for a new one.</p>
