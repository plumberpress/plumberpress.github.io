<p>Our plumbers are licensed, bonded, and insured and meet our rigid trust certification standards. A good rule of thumb is to replace faucets that show deterioration, rust, fractures, and otherwise deep damages. Run-down and rusted parts make repairs hard and pricey, suggesting a faucet installation is more rewarding. Repairs are the correct fix for concerns such as missing or damaged washers, aerators, nuts, bolts, and other small components of the entire component. If these repairs and replacements do not work or if the repairs cost over 30% of the cost of changing your faucet, then we suggest a brand-new faucet installation.</p>

If your house is over 50 years old, it's a good bet it's time to replace the plumbing, at a minimum cost of $2,000 and an optimum of $15,000. The large variation in cost is because of the size of your home, the kind of pipe you're installing, and additional repairs you find you need to make at any time you go behind walls.</p>
<p>Having another concern with your toilet? You're most likely questioning if it's going to require more than an easy repair this time-or possibly even a brand-new toilet if so.
