<p>Leaks are sneaky. In time, the resin beads in the water softener will end up being covered with calcium and magnesium ions, reducing their capacity to soften difficult water. Through a procedure called regeneration, water is instantly flushed through the water softener with a focused quantity of regenerant. Now the resin beads pick up the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the firmness on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems feature an entire home water filtration with its patented self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the dissolved rock and dirt and sediment are sent out down the drain. With the resin beads recharged," the water softener returns to service, providing the entire home with clean, soft water.</p>
