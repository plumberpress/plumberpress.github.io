<p>Once the test results reveal the repair is total, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was isolated during the repair process. It is important that the plumbing system be turned on very gradually to assure no damage is done to the piping system. As soon as the system is pressurized, air needs to be eliminated from the plumbing system. Each outlet on the plumbing system must be inspected to ensure no valves were inadvertently left open or did not close correctly when re-pressurized. Once the plumbing system is pressurized, make certain all valves are totally open and inform the water user that the plumbing system has been returned to service.</p>
