The pipes themselves should be at least a 1/2" in size to supply appropriate flow.</p>
<p>Toilet repair tends to freak the majority of people out a little, which is completely understandable. Nobody wants to inadvertently break something that could flood their bathroom with raw sewage. However, most of toilet repairs are easy and uncomplicated tasks - such as replacing a worn flapper - that many people can do themselves in about 5 minutes.
