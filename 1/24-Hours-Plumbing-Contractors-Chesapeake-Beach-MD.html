<h3>Frozen Pipes in Chesapeake Beach Maryland</h2>

<p>How does ion exchange work? A chemical and physical process filters the water through an exchange media referred to as resin or zeolite. Usually, the resin is a artificial or natural , sand-like product covered with positively charged salt ions.

The water flows through the unit while the resin launches its salt ions and easily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water draining of the device is now considered soft.</p>
