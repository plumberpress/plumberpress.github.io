<p>Difficult water is brought on by high levels of calcium and magnesium in the water. Water softeners deal with the water by using salt and ion-exchange resins to remove these minerals. When the water is available in contact with the resins, the calcium and magnesium ions transfer out of the water and onto the active sites on the resin. Then they are replaced in the option by the sodium ions.</p>
<p>Reverse osmosis uses an applied pressure gradient across a semi permeable membrane to overcome osmotic pressure and eliminate water particles from the option with solidity ions. The membrane has pores large enough to admit water molecules for passage; hardness ions such as Ca2+ and Mg2+ will not fit through the pores. The resulting soft supply of water is without hardness ions without any other ions being added. Membranes are a kind of water filter needing routine cleaning or replacement maintenance.</p>
