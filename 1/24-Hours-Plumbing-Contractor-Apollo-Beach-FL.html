<p>Considering that 1980, backflow preventers have been lawfully mandated for certain buildings by the New York Sanitary Code and the Rules of the City of New York. The guideline was not strictly imposed till a push in current years by the DEP's Cross-Connection Control Program, an initiative that includes regular random inspections of New York City buildings to make certain they are in compliance.</p>
<p>From below the sink, position a rubber gasket and metal or fiber friction ring over the strainer. Secure the gasket and friction ring by screwing on the drain locking ring. Next, ensure the drain compression seal is seated properly in the drain locknut, then reinstall and tighten the drain locknut. Finally, switch on the water and test for leaks.</p>
<p>Lots of bad things are being stated on this post about liners. I find that many old time plumbers are not educated on liners and have no idea on what they are saying. Will also say something doesn't work well simply because they don't like the technology and not because it doesn't work. If this heater is installed in a house with multiple restrooms, the piping process adds to the installation expenses.</p>
