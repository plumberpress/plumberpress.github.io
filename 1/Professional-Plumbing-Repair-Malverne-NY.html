<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one need to first think about problems with the salt that is utilized, or mechanical malfunctions of softener parts. When these components are not the reason for the unsatisfactory water softening, it might be time to replace the softener resin, or maybe even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners get rid of the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in hard water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. When all the ions are completely exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regrowth procedure to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with brand-new sodium ions.</p>
<p>Fountains and garden ponds: Automatic refills on these water features need to have either a PVB, an AVB or RP backflow preventers. These water functions are thought about a health risk if backflows take place from them. Refill lines and the backflow preventer type and area should be indicated on building plans. Any backflow preventer installed on a fountain or garden pond must be checked upon installation and then each year.</p>
