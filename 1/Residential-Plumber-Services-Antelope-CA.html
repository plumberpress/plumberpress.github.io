<p>Suggestion: Both anti-siphon valves and pressure vacuum breakers can not prevent back-pressure. I just recently had a number of plumbing leakages repaired and couldn't be happier with the prompt service I received from Parker and Sons. They are really well-informed, friendly, fairly priced, and do quality work. I would definitely advise them to my family and everybody. I would trust them to repair any leak in your home.</p>
<p>All of the drains in your home, from your toilets, sinks, tubs, and showers all drain into one main drain under your house then exit into the sewer or septic system from your house. When you experience blockages in numerous drains at once in your house, then that generally means that your main sewer line is backing up. This can happen in numerous places and any combination of drains. For example, water might fill up in your bathtub when you run your washing machine. There are a number of combinations of this kind of backup. The point is your drains all link, and when you have a backup in your main sewer line, you'll experience backup and overflowing from multiple drain lines in your home.</p>
