<p>In cold environments, soil, waste or water pipes need to not be installed beyond a home, in outside walls, in attics, or crawlspaces, or in another other location subjected to freezing temperature level unless some arrangements are made to safeguard it from freezing by insulation or heat. Many new houses include modern-day cooking areas-- stainless steel home appliances, energy-efficient stovetops and varieties, and garbage disposals. However, many houses more than twenty years of age do not have a waste disposal unit in their kitchen sink.</p>
