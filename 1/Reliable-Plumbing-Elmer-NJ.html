They need as much as 7 feet of clearance from the floor to ceiling, because the heat pump is on top of the hot water heater.

<p>Please let EBMUD know of any scenario that might need a backflow device. In some cases conditions on homes change that might need a backflow device, such as treating a boiler with ingredients or installing a well with a pump. Sewer repairs are more than a trouble for your business, they can trigger financial losses and in some circumstances can stop your business entirely. For restaurants having a drain back up or a sewer line break can be devastating. Even in a small office the problems triggered by even small drain problems can trigger major concerns.</p>

Without consistent testing and maintenance, these systems can enable polluted water to flow easily within your supply pipes, creating a serious health danger to developing occupants. Each backflow prevention system requires various testing procedures and intervals, and needs considerable experience and knowledge.</p>
