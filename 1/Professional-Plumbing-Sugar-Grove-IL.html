<h3>The 5 Most Useful Tools For De-Clogging in Sugar Grove IL 60554</h3>
<p>A toilet auger works the opposite method that a plunger does. Instead of dislodging the clog with unfavorable pressure, it in fact presses into the clog, working further into where the obstruction is taking place. The auger or snake" is then utilized to press the clog out of the drain pipe, leaving a clear path for water to flow freely. The auger's corkscrew-shaped pointer helps require it even more down into the clog, making it easier to clear.</p>
