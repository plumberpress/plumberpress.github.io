The pipes themselves must be at least a 1/2" in diameter to offer adequate flow.</p>
<p>A continuous-feed waste disposal unit is the most common type which continues to run as long as the power switch is on. A continuous-feed disposal is best for combating big amounts of food waste. The majority of garbage disposals are plug-in, as it is more secure to have a vibrating unit come unplugged then disconnected from stationary electrical wiring. However, some sinks do not have actually a plug-in installed underneath, and it may take an electrical contractor and even allows to get one installed on its own dedicated circuit.</p>
