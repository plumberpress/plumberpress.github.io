<p>A water softener is made up of a mineral tank and a backflush tank. It gathers hardness minerals within its conditioning tank and from time to time flushes them away to drain. Ion exchangers are typically used for water softening. When an ion exchanger is applied for water softening, it will replace the calcium and magnesium ions in the water with other ions such as salt or potassium. The outcome of our sophisticated water softener technology is healthier, smoother water for you and your family, while still maintaining an effective circulation rate.</p>
<p>It's a strangely complicated clinical procedure, but simple to fix. It uses salt to eliminate minerals and smells discovered in difficult water- most typically calcium and magnesium. Water softener systems use resin beads that attach and draw in sodium ions in the softener tank. Pumps push hard water through the resin beads exchanging solidity ions with sodium ions, softening the water.</p>
