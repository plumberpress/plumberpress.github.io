<p>Atmospheric Vacuum Breaker - Design GFAVB - The atmospheric vacuum breaker is among the least costly backflow prevention assembly. The GFAVB is a non-testable unit and benefit back siphonage only for non-health risk or health risk conditions. They need to be installed downstream from any shut down valves and can not be under pressure for more than 12 hours. , if an GFAVB is used backflow prevention on a watering system you must install one GFAVB after every valve for each zone in the system.. It should also be set up at least 6 inches (150 mm) greater than the highest outlet in the system (some GFAVB manufacturers, and some local officials, require that they be installed 12 inches (300 mm) higher than the greatest outlet). Some municipalities do not enable the use of GFAVB's. These systems will NOT avoid backflow pressure and can just protect against back siphonage.</p>

<p>How does ion exchange work? A physical and chemical  procedure filters the water through an exchange media called resin or zeolite. Generally, the resin is a natural or artificial, sand-like product coated with favorably charged sodium ions. As the calcium and magnesium liquifies into positively charged ions, an ion exchange environment is created. The water streams through the system while the resin releases its salt ions and readily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water flowing out of the device is now considered soft.</p>
