The need upstream might cause a reversal in flow.</p>

<p>Water softeners include value to your operation by safeguarding your water-using devices from bad efficiency and early failure. Some tough water problems are very visible, like dispensers and sprayers becoming clogged. Other problems can go undetected, like scale on water heater components and buildup in reverse osmosis (RO) membranes. Undetectable or noticeable, these problems have real costs connected with them. Clogged components trigger replacement or refurbishing expenses and can irritate your customers. Scale buildup in your water heater will inflate your energy costs, and too soon harmed RO membranes will leave you with unnecessary replacement costs.
