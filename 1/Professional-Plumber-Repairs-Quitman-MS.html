<p>Soft water is safe to drink. During the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do release sodium into the water when getting ahold of the hardness minerals. However the amount of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and in fact is far less than what is extensively thought of. If you have reasonably hard water, for example 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only including 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended everyday salt intake. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the amount of salt included by water softeners is minimal.</p>
