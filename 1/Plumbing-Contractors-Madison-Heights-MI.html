<h3>Clearing Blocked Drains in Madison Heights MI 48071</h3>
<p>Water that has been completely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is hungry for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have been removed-- destructive. For this reason, WQA suggests that typical metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) must not be used downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not remove the TDS and do not cause this type of rust A softener is just recording some cations (primarily calcium and magnesium) and launching other cations at the same time (normally sodium or in some cases potassium).</p>
