<p>Backflow is water streaming in the opposite instructions from its regular flow. IRWD's potable water system is developed to keep the water flowing to you. When hydraulic conditions within any water system deviate from "regular," the direction of water circulation can be reversed. This creates a backflow condition and the potential for infected water entering the potable water circulation system.</p>
<p>A few of the reasons for drain line blockages in kitchen drains are years of drain build-up, a failing garbage disposal, or too much food being gotten rid of down the drain. We will typically recommend our PowerSnake or ZOOM Jetting ® services, depending on the seriousness of the situation. Give us a call if your kitchen drain has raised water levels, is making gurgling sounds, smells foul, or is slow to drain.</p>
<p>The majority of backflow preventers are created to allow the elements to be eliminated for repair while the main body remains installed in the piping system. Eliminating the backflow preventer to repair it is not required in many cases. Some components such as relief valve bodies may need to be gotten rid of from the main body to help with a repair. Understanding the correct order for disassembly of the backflow preventer can be crucial.</p>
