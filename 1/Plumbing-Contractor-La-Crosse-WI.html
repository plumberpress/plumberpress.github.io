<h3>Quality Plumbing Services In La Crosse WI</h3>
<p>A. Usually wax doesn't "go bad" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to prevent smells. If you are experiencing a leak coming from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or complete blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Also, make certain the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" undiscovered issue. Attempt putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>It's essential to be mindful that most scale and mineral build-up in toilet bowls is triggered by tough water if your problem is more associated to scale and mineral build-up. Hard water generally leaves lime and calcium accumulation which can become rather unattractive. While phosphoric acid and other cleaning techniques will certainly assist, we highly recommend you look into setting up a water softener to help with your difficult water.</p>
