<p>Water softening describes the removal of magnesium, calcium, and other minerals from water. The most popular approach of water softening is through a process called ion exchange. Throughout ion exchange, mineral ions are traded for another kind of ion-- typically sodium. The result is water that's been successfully softened by removing nearly all traces of the minerals that constitute difficult water.</p>

<h3>Why Plumbers Should Install Water Heaters in Crystal Lake IL 60014?</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to manage peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively adjust to your business' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high flow need, tanks come on-line to include flow rate capability. During periods of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new method to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation technology, and it's perhaps the most important innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
