If you are experiencing a leak coming from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or complete blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Also, make certain the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" undiscovered problem. If you aren't sure where the leak is originating from, try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours.</p>
