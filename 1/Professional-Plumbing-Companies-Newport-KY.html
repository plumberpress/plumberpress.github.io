<p>A testable backflow prevention device has 2 check valves-- generally two layers of defense.

There are two various kinds of testable backflow prevention gadgets that are commonly defined-- a lowered pressure zone backflow device and a double check backflow device. There are a few others that I will point out but do not get hung up on them. I mention them only since they will be on a certification test.</p>

<p>Blending evaporated salt with rock salt is not suggested, as this could clog the softening reservoir.

<p>Replacing your flapper may need slightly various actions than we show (Images 2 and 3). Your flapper may screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube.
