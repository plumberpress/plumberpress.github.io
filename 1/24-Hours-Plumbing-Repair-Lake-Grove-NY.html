<p>Our plumbers are licensed, bonded, and insured and satisfy our stiff trust certification standards.

<p>A garbage disposal lasts an average of 10 to 12 years. This average life expectancy estimation assumes regular wear and tear of the system.

<h3>Pipe Cleaning in Lake Grove New York</h2>

Blanton Plumbing are licensed and skilled, and we can ensure your disposal will be installed properly and work exactly as it should. Give us a call today if you wish to include one to your kitchen sink for benefit. The cost to install a disposal will depend upon the kind of disposal system you purchase, whether you need to replace an old disposal or install an entirely new system, and any additional electric or plumbing work needed. The kind of waste disposal unit you buy will have the greatest effect on your installation expenses.</p>
<p>The real procedure of setting up a disposal must be finished with caution. There are dangers included due to the fact that you are dealing with blades, electrical energy, and water. There are likewise many tools and products involved which you may not have. The process needs to be technically precise, and it is suggested to avoid accidents by utilizing the services of a professional.</p>
<p>Take an example: State the your heater is 8 years of ages and you have to employ a plumber for that burner package. The overall repair costs may be in the $300 range. A gas water heater (not counting various plumbing parts) costs $400 to $1200 (electric water heaters cost about $400 to $800). That repair expense is nearly half the cost of the heater itself, and it's an old heater on its last legs anyway. Choose the brand-new heater.</p>
