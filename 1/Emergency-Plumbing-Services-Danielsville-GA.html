<p>In truth, reverse flow testing designed to make sure that backflow preventers avoid backflow was eliminated from NFPA 25 in 2011. While NFPA recognizes that backflow remains a legitimate health concern, it considers avoiding it outside the scope of NFPA 25. Rather, NFPA presumes that local or state requirements will guarantee that backflow preventers are correctly tested by qualified personnel.</p>
<p>Difficult water is triggered by high levels of calcium and magnesium in the water. Water softeners treat the water by utilizing salt and ion-exchange resins to eliminate these minerals. When the water can be found in contact with the resins, the calcium and magnesium ions move out of the water and onto the active sites on the resin. Then they are changed in the service by the salt ions.</p>
