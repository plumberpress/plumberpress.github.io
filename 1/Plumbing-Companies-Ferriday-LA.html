<p>Have actually utilized Plumb Crazy on 3 different occasions, the last involving a water line repair for a leak under the cement slab in our home. Billy and Hector were our technicians and they were fantastic. They rapidly discovered the leak and fixed it without making a huge mess. They, as with each person we have actually experienced with Plumb Crazy, were considerate, prompt, and very well-informed. I would suggest Plumb Crazy to anybody requiring either small or large job plumbing work.</p>
