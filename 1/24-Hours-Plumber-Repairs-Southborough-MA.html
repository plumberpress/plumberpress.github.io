<p>A water softener has two tanks: a mineral tank and a salt water tank. The mineral tank is where the real ion exchange, or water softening, occurs. It's filled with little, negatively-charged polystyrene beads called resin or zeolite. The brine tank is where the sodium, or salt, is saved and mixed with water. If you prepare to drain  your automatic dishwasher through your disposer, find the breakout plate inside the inlet port (Image 1). Eliminate it by gently punching it with a screwdriver and hammer (Image 2). Leave the breakout plate intact if you will not utilize your unit to drain a dishwasher.</p>
