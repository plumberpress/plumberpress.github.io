<h3>Quality Plumbing Service Peru IN</h3>
<p>Professional drain cleaning and plumbing blockage service might appear like a waste of money. Why buy professional drain repair service when a chemical drain cleaner will do the trick?

Handling fixing a burst pipe is certainly not worth the savings incurred from utilizing a chemical drain cleaner.</p>

<h3>Unclog Drains, Toilets and Sewers With The Help of Plumbers at Peru IN 46970</h3>
<p>I purchased a "Deal" for $200 toward plumbing services. I have a rental and wished to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and changing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The composed quote to clean 3 sinks and two tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Only one sink drain was even partly clogged. So, given that I had a "offer" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (consisting of tax) for the one sink drain. I searched for notes from last time I had the precise sink cleaned from another company and it just cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper just cost $118 + tax) which was only 9 months ago. I feel that prices were increased since I had a "Offer". An Angie's list short article from March stated depending on the market and severity of clog, the average cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Shame on me for not bringing my past invoice to be sure I wasn't getting rate gouged.</p>
