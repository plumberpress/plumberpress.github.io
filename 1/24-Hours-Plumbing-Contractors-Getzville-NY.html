<p>A cross-connection is any short-lived or permanent connection in between a public water system or customer's drinkable (i.e., drinking) water supply and any source or system consisting of nonpotable water or other compounds. An example is the piping between a public water supply or customer's potable water supply and an auxiliary water system, cooling system or watering system.</p>

Typically, it is possible to do the bulk of the work that requires total water turned off while you are out and about during the day, so you experience very little disruption to your everyday regimen.
