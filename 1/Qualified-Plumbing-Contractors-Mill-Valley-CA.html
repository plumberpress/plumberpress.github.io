<p>The Plumbing and Gas Piping Program IVR system is now accepting inspection demands. No warm water in your home? Is your water taking too long to warm up? Is your hot water heater making noises, or do you see rusty colored water in your home? If you have any of these concerns, your water heater might need maintenance, repairs or perhaps a replacement. While a few of these problems can be credited to normal wear and tear or inappropriate installation, in some cases your waste disposal unit ends up being damaged by products that should not be run through it.</p>
