<p>Another drawback of water softening through ion exchange is the prospective health danger for people on low salt diets. Ion exchange increases the amount of sodium in water, in order to reduce its mineral content. Typically, this process includes 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending upon how tough the water was to begin with. Harder water will result in more sodium, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this increase in sodium is minor, but if you've been advised by a doctor to follow a stringent low sodium diet plan this increase can present problems.</p>
<p>The heating element is taking longer to heat the water than it should if the water feels warm. However this particular problem is when you have no hot water flowing in your house. The factors for this can range from leaks, faulty or malfunctioning electrical wiring, or a broken heating component or thermostat. A repair or replacement of the components may suffice if it is one of the discussed problems. Nevertheless, if the hot water heater system has all of these problems taking place frequently, then a water heater replacement is required.</p>
