<p>Backpressure backflow in a building results when the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the incoming safe and clean water supply. Backpressure can be triggered by pumps or temperature level increases in boilers, or if there is a decrease in the water supply pressure. Backsiphonage takes place when negative or reduced pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, generally due to a disturbance or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or nearby firefighting activity. To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A typical kind of backflow preventer is the lowered pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
