Some elements might have extremely tight tolerances that need to be kept. An essential thing to identify on each component is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the motion or directs of the component. The guide is a really important part of the design of each component. If the element is not repaired appropriately, the guide could restrict the movement (instead of direct or consistent) of the element, which could cause the part to not work to its capabilities.
