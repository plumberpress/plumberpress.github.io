<p>Remove the waste line. Get rid of the "P" trap waste line running from the disposal by utilizing a wrench to loosen the slip-nut linking the disposal to the trap. You might want to place a container under the trap to capture any wastewater sitting in the bottom. Regular maintenance can help avoid hot water heater failure and extend the life of your devices.

<p>Soft water is safe to drink. During the ion exchange process, the resin beads do launch sodium into the water when grabbing ahold of the solidity minerals. However the quantity of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and in fact is far less than what is extensively imagined. If you have reasonably hard water, for example 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only adding 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested daily salt consumption. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the quantity of salt added by water softeners is minimal.</p>
