<p>Loose flanges are typically the result of wood rot. The flange screws just will not hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best service depends on the extent of the rot. If the rot is only under the flange, utilize an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood farther away from the flange. Prior to you install this type of ring, hold it up to the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might need to cut off a couple of ears to make it deal with your toilet. You'll have to replace a section of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>

Throughout a video camera inspection, a sewer and drain technician runs a video cable television down sewer branch lines that lead from bath tubs, sinks, and other drains into the main sewer line. Using the images captured by the camera, we can identify any sewer and drain line problems, such as blockages, tree root intrusion, misaligned joints, cracks, and other damage.</p>
