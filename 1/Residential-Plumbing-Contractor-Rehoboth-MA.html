<p>When your bathtub drains or your toilet flushes is never a great indication, a weird gurgling sound. Do not depend upon a plunger to fix the issue-- depend on your plumber for sewer line repair. As we have stated before backflow prevention devices and assemblies decrease pressure and volume available to the life security and property security systems.  The majority of fire sprinkler heads, other than sprinkler heads on a deluge system are kept closed by a heat-sensitive operating mechanism. Typically, this operating mechanism is either a fusible link or a glass bulb.  Regardless of the operating mechanism, only the sprinklers that are exposed to heat will open during a fire.</p>
