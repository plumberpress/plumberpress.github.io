Variations in line pressure, upstream or downstream, will prompt a properly functioning RPZ assembly to occasionally discharge small amounts of water. Throughout a backflow condition, a big volume of water will flow from the relief valve. For this reason, RPZ assemblies shouldn't be set up in locations subject to water damage. Sufficient drainage must likewise be provided.</p>
