<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Instead of a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to manage peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to efficiently get used to your business' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high flow need, tanks come online to include flow rate capability. Throughout periods of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This new approach to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation innovation, and it's perhaps the most essential innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
