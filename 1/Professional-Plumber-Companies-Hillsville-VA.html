<p>Deterioration: The most common problem is rust in the tank and pipes that connect to your hot water heater. This is particularly real if you have without treatment difficult water, which contains extreme minerals that can connect to the piping and tank and break down the material with time. Whether it's calcium, iron, or another aspect that is triggering the rust, you will ultimately experience a leak in your hot water heater that is challenging to repair. Leakages typically indicate a brand-new unit replacement remains in order.</p>
