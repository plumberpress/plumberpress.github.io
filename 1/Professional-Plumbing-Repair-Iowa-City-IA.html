<p>From beneath the sink, position a rubber gasket and metal or fiber friction ring over the strainer. Secure the gasket and friction ring by screwing on the drain locking ring. Next, make sure the drain compression seal is seated properly in the drain locknut, then tighten the drain and reinstall locknut. Lastly, switch on the water and test for leakages.</p>
<p>Physical strength. Steamfitters, plumbers, and pipefitters must have the ability to raise and move heavy tools and products. Idea: Place a heavy object such as the disposal itself in the sink to weigh down the flange and keep it from moving during installation. Loosen the clamp and get rid of the dishwasher drain hose from the disposal. Trying to clean the pipes or treat the water with chemicals will not fix the issue, as the pipes are deteriorating slowly from the inside. For the most part, repiping is your only feasible choice.</p>
