<h3>The Dreaded Blocked Toilet in Washington UT 84780</h3>
<p>As the pipes continue to age, flakes of rust will accumulate in various parts of the plumbing system, the majority of commonly in shower heads, faucets, and shut-off valves. This can cause low circulation issues and even stop a fixture from streaming entirely. The next common issue that happens with older galvanized pipes is the arterial sclerosis" of the system, which occurs when the swelling of the pipes gets to be so serious that it lowers the available volume of water that can flow around the system.</p>
<p>Hydro jetting is a procedure in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at approximately 3,500 PSI. This allows the sewer lines to be cleaned up rapidly and efficiently with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, discharging from the forward and reverse jets in the nozzle, move the hose through the line to get rid of particles such as difficult water scale, silt, grease, and sand deposits.</p>
<p>That said, you do not always need to drain 10s of thousands of dollars on repairing your home's pipe or sewer lines.
