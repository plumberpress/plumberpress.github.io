Handling repairing a burst pipe is definitely not worth the savings incurred from utilizing a chemical drain cleaner.</p>
<p>Soft water is safe to consume. Throughout the ion exchange process, the resin beads do release salt into the water when grabbing ahold of the hardness minerals. But the amount of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and actually is far less than what is widely thought of.

That's less than 2% of the recommended daily sodium consumption. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the amount of salt added by water softeners is minimal.</p>
