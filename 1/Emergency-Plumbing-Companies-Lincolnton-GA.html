<h3>Quality Plumbing Service Lincolnton GA</h3>
<p>Our professional plumbers provide preventive maintenance, plumbing repairs and emergency maintenance When you ask for a preventative maintenance service call, you can expect us to completely check your plumbing pipes for indications of leakages, corrosion and malfunctioning or broken water-using appliances, like toilets, showers, sinks and hot water heater.

<p>Soft water is safe to consume. During the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do release salt into the water when grabbing ahold of the firmness minerals. However the quantity of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and in fact is far less than what is extensively imagined. If you have moderately difficult water, for example 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only including 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended daily sodium intake. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the amount of salt added by water softeners is minimal.</p>
