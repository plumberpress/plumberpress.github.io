<p>Organic particles, such as hair, grease, or food stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is frequently the reason for clogged drains. The most typical method a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's cable, snake or drain auger. The tool is thoroughly placed down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can try to do this yourself, but this isn't a beginner's DIY project. If you use the tool incorrectly, you can harm your pipes and cause other leakages - so it's worth it to call someone who knows the drill.</p>
