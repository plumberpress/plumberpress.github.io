<p>When your bathtub drains or your toilet flushes is never a good sign, an odd gurgling sound. Don't depend upon a plunger to correct the problem-- depend upon your plumber for sewer line repair. As we have stated before backflow prevention devices and assemblies minimize pressure and volume offered to the life security and home defense systems.  Many fire sprinkler heads, other than sprinkler heads on a deluge system are kept closed by a heat-sensitive operating mechanism. Normally, this operating system is either a fusible link or a glass bulb.  Regardless of the operating mechanism, only the sprinklers that are exposed to heat will open throughout a fire.</p>
