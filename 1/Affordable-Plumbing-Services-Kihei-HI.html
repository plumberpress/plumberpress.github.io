<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, however he charged $300 plus tax. Rather of repairing the leak, he wanted to replace the entire piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he could not simply fix the fittings instead of a complete replace. He stated he would change the washers and that might do it. He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted no additional repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there given that it wasn't on a load. As soon as he left, my tenants tried the sink and it was still leaking. Since he had another appointment, they called him back and he stated he would not come back. An ideal bad plumber story.</p>
