We do not suggest attempting to repair this specific device by yourself, because it does present a security risk, due to the sharp blades that are used to grind and chop waste.

To start the repiping procedure, the plumbing team will initially cover any carpet and furnishings to safeguard them from dust and debris. They will then make small cuts in the wall and drywall to find the pipes and after that remove and replace them, leaving as much of the original structure material as possible undamaged.</p>
