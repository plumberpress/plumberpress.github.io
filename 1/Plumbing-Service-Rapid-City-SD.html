<p>Leaks are tricky. Gradually, the resin beads in the water softener will become covered with calcium and magnesium ions, reducing their capacity to soften tough water.

WaterBoss water softener systems feature an entire house water filtration with its patented self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the liquified rock and dirt and sediment are sent out down the drain. With the resin beads charged," the water softener returns to service, offering the whole house with clean, soft water.</p>
<p>Market prices for home water softeners might vary from approximately $400 to $2,700, depending on the size and type of softener. Softeners are ranked by the overall variety of grains the unit can remove prior to being recharged.
