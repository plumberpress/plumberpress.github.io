<h3>Why Do You Need a Drain Cleaning Service in Albertville AL 35950?</h3>

<p>How does ion exchange work? A chemical and physical process filters the water through an exchange media known as resin or zeolite. Typically, the resin is a natural or synthetic, sand-like product coated with favorably charged sodium ions. As the calcium and magnesium liquifies into positively charged ions, an ion exchange environment is developed. The water streams through the system while the resin releases its sodium ions and easily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water flowing out of the device is now considered soft.</p>
