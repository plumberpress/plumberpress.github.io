Howard, the Task Supervisor, has actually always been practical and informative concerning all our issues. He did the proposal and scheduled the work for the clear out and partial sewer line repair quickly. It is constantly a satisfaction to deal with him. Derek snaked the laundry line and outside kitchen sink line which has a "Y". He had the ability to get a snake around the "Y", which lots of plumbers state they can't do, and clear the line. He is always pleasant, professional and goes above and beyond.</p>

<p>The new inlets and outlets on the tank do not constantly line up with the old supply lines. Solder in a set of 45-degree fittings to offset each line if required. Likewise replace the old shutoff valve with a new ball valve while you're at it (Photo 6). Vent sizes are sized according to the heat output of the hot water heater. You might need to increase or decrease the vent size to guarantee the best draft. CARE: If you're unsure if your chimney has a liner, ask your plumbing inspector.</p>

<p>A toilet auger works the opposite way that a plunger does. Rather than removing the blockage with unfavorable pressure, it really presses into the blockage, working further into where the obstruction is happening. The auger or snake" is then used to push the clog out of the drain pipe, leaving a clear path for water to stream easily. The auger's corkscrew-shaped pointer helps require it even more down into the clog, making it simpler to clear.</p>
