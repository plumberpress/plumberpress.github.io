<p>The easiest mechanical backflow prevention device is the vacuum breaker assembly (VBA). It has one moving part, a moveable disc connected to a climatic vent. In case of a siphon, the pressure in the valve will drop below that of the outdoors air. This sets off the disc to open, allowing air to get in the valve and bring back pressure comparable to ambient climatic requirement. This restoration of pressure breaks the siphon and prevents cross contamination.</p>

<p>The use of different metals in the plumbing can result in galvanic rust Direct contact between different metals will initiate the development of a galvanic cell, which is developed whenever two various types of metal are conductively connected to each other, and then immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be rusted and an electrical current is produced since of the process. A typical example of this is when galvanized pipe is directly connected to copper pipe. It is likewise worth noting that while using a brass fitting to bridge the space in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not entirely prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to mitigate this direct contact in between the dissimilar metals. A dielectric coupling includes an insulating material that physically separates contact in between the two metals.</p>
