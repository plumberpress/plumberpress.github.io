<p>A backflow preventer is a method or system to avoid backflow. The basic means of preventing backflow is an air space, which either gets rid of a cross-connection or provides a barrier to backflow. The fundamental system for preventing backflow is a mechanical backflow preventer, which supplies a physical barrier to backflow. The primary kinds of mechanical backflow preventers are the reduced-pressure concept assembly, the pressure vacuum breaker assembly, and the double check valve assembly.</p>
