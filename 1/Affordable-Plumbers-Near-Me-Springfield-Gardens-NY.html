<h3>Most Common Residential Plumbing Emergencies Springfield Gardens NY</h3>
<p>The majority of houses or buildings that were constructed in the 1970s usually have galvanized piping. Over time, the plumbing system can wear out and the pipes can start to corrode. This can trigger low water pressure and affect the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping consists of iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to offer weather protection. As the outer finishing of zinc begins to deteriorate, the pipe is exposed to water and moisture, triggering the iron to ultimately rust.</p>
