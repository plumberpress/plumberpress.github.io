<p>When the test results reveal the repair is total, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was isolated throughout the repair process. It is important that the plumbing system be switched on very slowly to ensure no damage is done to the piping system. When the system is pressurized, air must be removed from the plumbing system.

As soon as the plumbing system is pressurized, be sure all valves are entirely open and notify the water user that the plumbing system has actually been returned to service.</p>
