<p>Here at High 5 Plumbing, our Denver drain cleaning group is proud to use Bio-Clean products for every single drain-cleaning job. Bio-Clean is an all-natural option that's both harmless to your plumbing and extremely effective at eliminating grime, waste, and natural material that so often clogs up your drain lines. Caustic drain cleaners run along the bottom of your pipes, rusting the sidewalls and only partially repairing the problem. Bio-Clean is a solution of live germs that actively seek out natural material and gnaw at it, producing harmless by-products of carbon mineral, water, and dioxide ash, all of which are easily dealt with at local sewage plants.</p>

The majority of apprenticeships are sponsored by local unions, companies or contractor companies. Programs usually last four to five years and require apprentices to complete a particular number of on-the-job training and technical education hours each year.</p>
