<p>Once the hardware parts have actually been cleaned up and inspected and the rubber parts have been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their parts. Some elements may have really tight tolerances that need to be kept. A crucial thing to recognize on each element is the guide.

If the component is not fixed correctly, the guide could restrict the movement (rather than direct or steady) of the component, which might trigger the element to not work to its capabilities. Lot of times springs are incorrectly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In most cases the guides are restricting the travel of the part triggering lower test results than what is needed.</p>
