<h3>Drain Cleaning in Davisburg MI 48350 : What You Need To Know?</h3>
<p>I purchased a "Offer" for $200 toward plumbing services. I have a rental and wished to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and replacing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The composed price quote to clean 3 sinks and two tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Just one sink drain was even partly clogged. So, because I had a "deal" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (consisting of tax) for the one sink drain. I looked up notes from last time I had the precise sink cleaned from another company and it only cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper just cost $118 + tax) which was only 9 months ago. I feel that prices were increased due to the fact that I had a "Offer". An Angie's list article from March stated depending on the marketplace and intensity of clog, the typical cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Shame on me for not bringing my previous receipt to be sure I wasn't getting cost gouged.</p>

The essential for regular fire defense applications, DCVs feature an inlet (upstream) shutoff valve, two individually operating spring-loaded check valves (usually inside a single valve body), 4 test dicks, and an outlet (downstream) shutoff valve.
