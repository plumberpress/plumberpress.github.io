If your disposal is frequently making sounds that are irregular for the machine, it might be in need of significant repairs or it could be nearing the end of its lifespan. Frequent blockages, even when you're barely washing down any food particles, might suggest a problem with the disposal.

A number of these leaks can be repaired, however if they become bigger and more regular, you need to consider total system replacement.</p>
<p>Light Blue = Reduced Pressure Zone - supply pressure pushes open the # 1 check and is decreased by the # 1 Inspect spring (for example, to 90 psi).

Rather of repairing the leak, he wished to replace the whole piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he couldn't just fix the fittings rather of a complete replace. He stated he would change the washers which may do it. He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted to no additional repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there given that it wasn't on a load. As quickly as he left, my renters attempted the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he said he would not return because he had another consultation. A best bad plumber story.</p>
