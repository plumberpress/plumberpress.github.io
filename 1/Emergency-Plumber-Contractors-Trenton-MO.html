<p>A water softener has two tanks: a mineral tank and a brine tank. The mineral tank is where the actual ion exchange, or water softening, happens. It's filled with little, negatively-charged polystyrene beads called resin or zeolite. The brine tank is where the sodium, or salt, is stored and blended with water. , if you prepare to drain your automated dishwasher through your disposer, find the breakout plate inside the inlet port (Image 1). Remove it by gently punching it with a screwdriver and hammer (Image 2). Leave the breakout plate intact if you will not utilize your system to drain a dishwasher.</p>
<p>Here's what to anticipate on the day of your hot water heater installation appointment. Installing natural gas lines can bring a brand-new level of service. As tough water passes through the mineral tank, the beads inside attract the positively-charged calcium and magnesium ions. The minerals that trigger tough water stick to the beads, and the cured water heads out into your house's plumbing system.</p>
