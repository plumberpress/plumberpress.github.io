<p>Caution: If used on a water supply where a pump and pressure tank provides the water (like is utilized on most rural houses that have a well), the PVB may spit water each time the pump shuts down. This is due to the fact that the pressure variations brought on by the pump and pressure tank system can trigger backflow from the watering system back into the water system. The probability of water spitting, and the amount of water that spits out, both increase with a longer mainline on the watering system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline in between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less most likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One method to stop, or a minimum of decrease, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB may still spill a little water with the check valve installed, nevertheless in many cases it must be much less water.</p>
