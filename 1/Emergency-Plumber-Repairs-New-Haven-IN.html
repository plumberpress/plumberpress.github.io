<p>You notice rust in your water: If you begin to notice rust in your water, it could be an indication that you need pipe repair or drain repair services. Rust typically leaks into the water supply when pipes have actually become rusty. Although rust isn't naturally hazardous for your health, it can be a sign of difficulty to come. If you purchase a replacement that's made by the exact same producer as your old model, you might be able to bypass the need to replace the waste assembly and mounting flange in the sink, considerably simplifying the task (it can be a bigger, more effective system-- it simply needs to have the same mounting flange).</p>
