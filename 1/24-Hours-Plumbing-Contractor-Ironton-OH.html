<p>The Plumbing and Gas Piping Program IVR system is now accepting inspection demands. No hot water in your home? Is your water taking too long to heat up? Is your water heater making sounds, or do you see rusty colored water in your house? If you have any of these problems, your water heater may need maintenance, repairs or even a replacement. While a few of these issues can be attributed to typical wear and tear or incorrect installation, in some cases your waste disposal unit becomes damaged by items that should not be run through it.</p>
