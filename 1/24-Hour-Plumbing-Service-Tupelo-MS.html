<p>Scrape off the old putty with a plastic putty knife so you do not scratch the sink. Seal the new basket in the sink with plumber's putty as displayed in Picture 4. Plumber's putty can not be used on particular new sinks, however these will be labeled to that effect. If you can't utilize plumber's putty, use a non-water-based silicone.
