<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one should first consider problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical malfunctions of softener parts. When these elements are not the reason for the unacceptable water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or possibly even the entire softener. Cation exchange water softeners remove the calcium and magnesium ions found in difficult water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions. When all the ions are fully exchanged, the water softener goes through a regeneration process to flush the system of excess ions and charge with brand-new salt ions.</p>
