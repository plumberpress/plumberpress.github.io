<h3>How Much Does A Plumber Cost Per Hour Lancaster CA</h3>
<p>Organic particles, such as hair, grease, or food stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the reason for clogged drains. The most common way a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool known as a plumber's snake, drain or cable auger. The tool is carefully placed down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can attempt to do this yourself, however this isn't a newbie's Do It Yourself project. If you utilize the tool incorrectly, you can harm your pipes and trigger other leakages - so it's worth it to call someone who knows the drill.</p>
