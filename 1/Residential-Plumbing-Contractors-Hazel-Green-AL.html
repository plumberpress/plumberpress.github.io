If there is a leak in a part of the sewer line running below your house's structure, the very best you can hope for is to discover quickly. Otherwise, as the leaky sewer line spills out beneath your home, a sinkhole will cause the structure to shift and establish fractures. In this case, you'll need expert plumbers as well as foundation repair experts.</p>
