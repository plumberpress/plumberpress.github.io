<h3>Most Effective Drain Cleaning Methods Newton MA</h3>
<p>A. Generally wax doesn't "go bad" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to avoid odors. If you are experiencing a leak originating from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or complete blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Also, ensure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" undiscovered problem. If you aren't sure where the leak is originating from, attempt putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours.</p>

<p>How does ion exchange work? A physical and chemical  process filters the water through an exchange media referred to as resin or zeolite. Typically, the resin is a artificial or natural , sand-like material covered with positively charged sodium ions. As the calcium and magnesium liquifies into positively charged ions, an ion exchange environment is produced. The water flows through the unit while the resin launches its sodium ions and easily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water flowing out of the device is now considered soft.</p>
