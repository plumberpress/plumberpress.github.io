<p>A backflow preventer is a way or system to prevent backflow. The standard means of avoiding backflow is an air gap, which either removes a cross-connection or offers a barrier to backflow.

The primary kinds of mechanical backflow preventers are the reduced-pressure principle assembly, the pressure vacuum breaker assembly, and the double check valve assembly.</p>

<h3>Residential Water Heater Repair and Replacement at Granger IN 46530</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to handle peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to effectively get used to your service' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high flow demand, tanks come online to include flow rate capacity. During durations of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This new technique to softening is called progressive or responsive flow technology, and it's arguably the most important innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
