<p>Our Water Softeners Are Remarkably Designed To Work. Your house's main gutter system collects rainwater from the roof line and controls its path down your home to ground; but the water might still puddle next to the foundation. That's where underground seamless gutter drains are helpful. They connect to the downspouts on your house and move water far from the foundation underground. Although you can't see into these drains, cleaning them is similar to a procedure used to clear debris from the side gutter pipes on your home.</p>
<p>Then attach the drain (and dishwasher hose, if relevant).
