Our tankless, natural citric acid water softener is the best-rated, salt-free water softener on the market-- that's why companies like Walgreens, HGTV, Popular Science, Panda Express, and more trust us to soften their water.</p>
<p>Another disadvantage of water softening through ion exchange is the prospective health threat for people on low sodium diets. Ion exchange increases the quantity of salt in water, in order to decrease its mineral content. Generally, this procedure includes 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending on how difficult the water was to begin with. Harder water will lead to more sodium, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For most people, this increase in salt is small, however if you've been advised by a doctor to follow a strict low sodium diet this increase can position problems.</p>
