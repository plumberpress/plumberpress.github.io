<p>Using different metals in the plumbing can result in galvanic rust Direct contact in between dissimilar metals will start the development of a galvanic cell, which is produced whenever two various kinds of metal are conductively connected to each other, and after that immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be corroded and an electrical current is produced since of the process. A common example of this is when galvanized pipe is directly linked to copper pipe. It is likewise worth noting that while using a brass fitting to bridge the space in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not completely prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to mitigate this direct contact in between the different metals. A dielectric coupling consists of an insulating material that physically separates contact between the 2 metals.</p>
