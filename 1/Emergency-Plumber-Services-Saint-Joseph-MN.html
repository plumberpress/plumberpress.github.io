<p>You may have heard stories about a hot water heater taking off inside a home or business! It is very important to understand that a plugged temperature and pressure relief valve on your water heater can turn your water heater into a harmful time bomb. The age of your hot water heater. A traditional tank hot water heater generally lasts anywhere from 8-12 years prior to requiring a replacement, while a tankless hot water heater can last approximately 20 with proper maintenance and care. If your system is getting up there in age, it might be best for your long-lasting expenses to replace it now.</p>
<p>Some pipe materials are cheaper than others; some are more fragile and vulnerable to breaking, displacement or other types of structural failure. Other products are susceptible to deterioration and rust while some are untouched. Specific pipe products have higher coefficients of heat pressure, making them more susceptible to structural stresses and strains as an outcome of temperature level change and ice development. And these differences dictate the potential need for backflow preventers.</p>

<p>Changing your flapper might require somewhat different actions than we show (Pictures 2 and 3). Your flapper might screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. Finding a replacement flapper might be the hardest part of the task if you have an unusual flush valve. To find a suitable replacement, turn off the water, take the old one with you to the house center or hardware shop. (Turn off the water prior to eliminating the flapper.) You may not find a similar match, however opportunities are you'll locate among the same shape and diameter. If not, try a plumbing supply store (in the Telephone Directory under Plumbing Products") or search online.</p>
