<h3>Most Common Plumbing Emergencies Denton TX</h3>
<p>A recently set up hot water heater ought to not produce strange noises, but it will start to produce rumbling noises as it ages. The noises get louder gradually as the heater runs to heat up the water. Things worsen drastically for homes with a high need for hot water. The factors for the noises can be the buildup of sediments in the tank which should be flushed to bring back normalcy. A water heater replacement may be necessary if the water heater still produces rumbling noises even after it has been flushed.</p>
