<p>The typical solution is to have the malfunctioning pipes replaced when you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes changed, which is where whole-house repiping is available in.

Steel was the most popular choice for home plumbing for numerous decades, but steel eventually suffers from deterioration and does not have the durability these days's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
