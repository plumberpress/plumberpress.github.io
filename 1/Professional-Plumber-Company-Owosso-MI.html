<p>The Plumbing and Gas Piping Program IVR system is now accepting inspection demands. No warm water in your house? Is your water taking too long to warm up? Is your water heater making sounds, or do you see rusty colored water in your house? If you have any of these issues, your water heater might need maintenance, repairs or even a replacement.
