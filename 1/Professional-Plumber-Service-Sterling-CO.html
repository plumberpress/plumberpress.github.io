When utilized in the context of a fire lawn sprinkler, a backflow preventer device is used to make sure that water does not stream from the sprinkler system back into the local supply of water, or other source of drinking water. Unfortunately, water kept in the sprinkler system can become polluted. If permitted to return to the water supply, there is capacity for the contaminated water to become a health danger. The backflow preventer is planned to prevent water receding towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be examined frequently for efficiency, as well as inspected each year by a fire inspection company in order to guarantee they are working as they should.</p>
