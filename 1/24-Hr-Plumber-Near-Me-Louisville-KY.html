<p>Changing your flapper may need slightly various steps than we show (Photos 2 and 3). Your flapper might screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. If you have an uncommon flush valve, finding a replacement flapper might be the hardest part of the job. To discover a suitable replacement, turn off the water, take the old one with you to the house center or hardware shop. (Shut off the water prior to eliminating the flapper.)

If not, try a plumbing supply store (in the Telephone Directory under Plumbing Materials") or search online.</p>
