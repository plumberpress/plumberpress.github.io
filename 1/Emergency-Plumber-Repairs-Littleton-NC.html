<h3>Useful Tips for Water Heater Repair at Littleton NC 27850</h3>
<p>I acquired a "Deal" for $200 towards plumbing services. I have a rental and wanted to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and changing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The written quote to clean 3 sinks and two tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Just one sink drain was even partly clogged. So, because I had a "deal" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (consisting of tax) for the one sink drain. I looked up notes from last time I had the exact sink cleaned from another company and it only cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper only cost $118 + tax) and that was only 9 months ago. I feel that rates were increased since I had a "Offer". An Angie's list short article from March said depending upon the marketplace and severity of clog, the typical cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Embarassment on me for not bringing my past receipt to be sure I wasn't getting cost gouged.</p>
<p>A Pilot burner That Has Actually Gone Out: If you are not getting any hot water at all, and you use a gas water heater instead of a system with an electric heating component, there is a great chance your pilot light has actually headed out. This might be because of a problem with your thermocouple, an absence of flammable air, or merely a strong breeze. Despite what the concern is, however, your hot water heater will not be able to work up until the pilot light is re-lit.</p>

<p>The normal option is to have the defective pipes replaced when you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes. Nevertheless, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes replaced, which is where whole-house repiping comes in. This is a choice to consider if you live in an older home - such as one constructed pre-1970 - or any home with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular choice for house plumbing for lots of years, but steel eventually suffers from rust and lacks the resilience of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
