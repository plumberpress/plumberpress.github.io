<p>You can use a wire coat wall mount by aligning it if you don't have a plumber's snake. Obviously, it won't reach as far as a plumber's snake would, however it might be long enough to reach some obstructions. Insert it into the kitchen drain or stub pipe to push through or pull out the clog if you can reach it. Beware not to scratch your sink with the wire.</p>
