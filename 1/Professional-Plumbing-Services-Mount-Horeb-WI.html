<p>In the first half of the twentieth century, a variety of products were used for house plumbing. Galvanized steel and cast iron were the most common metals, while clay was utilized for sewer line piping. Although all these products are durable in the short-term, they degrade over years.

After about fifty years, they'll begin to damage from rust and may place contaminants into the freshwater supply. We advise changing the clay, steel, and iron pipes in your house.
