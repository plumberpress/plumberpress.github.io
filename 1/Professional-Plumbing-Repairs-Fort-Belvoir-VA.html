<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, however he charged $300 plus tax. Rather of fixing the leak, he wished to replace the entire piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he couldn't simply fix the fittings rather of a complete replace. He stated he would change the washers and that might do it. He then disconnected the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he left with no further repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there since it wasn't on a load. As quickly as he left, my renters attempted the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he said he would not return since he had another appointment. A perfect bad plumber story.</p>
<p>Backpressure backflow in a building results when the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the incoming potable water system. Backpressure can be brought on by pumps or temperature increases in boilers, or if there is a reduction in the water supply pressure. Backsiphonage occurs when unfavorable or decreased pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, normally due to a disturbance or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or neighboring firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A typical kind of backflow preventer is the decreased pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
