It's filled with little, negatively-charged polystyrene beads called resin or zeolite. The salt water tank is where the salt, or salt, is saved and combined with water. If you prepare to drain  your automatic dishwasher through your disposer, locate the breakout plate inside the inlet port (Image 1).

Remember that because of the method a lever works, the locknuts for a lot of toilet journey levers will be reverse threaded so make sure you're turning things the right method.
