Instead of a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to handle peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively get used to your service' flow rates throughout the day.

This brand-new method to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation technology, and it's perhaps the most essential development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
