Each of our professionals cleans up thousands of drains in a year, more than the average plumber cleans in a lifetime. That's why we do drains better than anybody else. - there's nothing ZOOM DRAIN Â® can't handle. Our Palmdale toilet repair and installation service technicians know that toilets can clog and malfunction at any time of day, which is why we provide exceptional service around the clock.

Ultimately, the water might not be able to drain quickly or effectively, and you might experience water pooling in your bathroom sink or a toilet that is continuously supporting. When this happens, it may be time to contact a professional from Atlas Plumbing to examine.</p>

<p>If you don't have a plumber's snake, you can use a wire coat wall mount by straightening it. Obviously, it won't reach as far as a plumber's snake would, however it might be long enough to reach some blockages. Place it into the kitchen drain or stub pipe to press through or pull out the clog if you can reach it. Take care not to scratch your sink with the wire.</p>
