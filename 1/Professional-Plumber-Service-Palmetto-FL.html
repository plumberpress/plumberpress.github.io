<h3>How Much Does A Plumber Cost Palmetto FL</h3>
<p>A. Generally wax does not "go bad" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to prevent smells. If you are experiencing a leak originating from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or full blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Also, ensure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" undetected problem. Try putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>If your problem is more related to scale and mineral accumulation, it is necessary to be aware that many scale and mineral build-up in toilet bowls is brought on by hard water. Difficult water usually leaves lime and calcium accumulation which can end up being quite unsightly. While phosphoric acid and other cleaning approaches will definitely help, we strongly recommend you look into setting up a water softener to help with your tough water.</p>
