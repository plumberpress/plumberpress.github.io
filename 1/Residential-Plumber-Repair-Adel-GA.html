Instead of a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to deal with peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively adjust to your company' circulation rates throughout the day. During durations of high circulation demand, tanks come online to add circulation rate capacity. During durations of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new approach to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation technology, and it's arguably the most important development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
