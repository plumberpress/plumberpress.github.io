<p>2 styles of PVBs are available: (1) Pressure Vacuum Breaker and (2) Spill Resistant Vacuum Breaker.

It includes shutoff valves at each end of the assembly and is equipped with test cocks. A PVB may be utilized to separate health or non-health dangers however is effective versus back-siphonage only.</p>
<p>Caution: If used on a water system where a pump and pressure tank supplies the water (like is used on the majority of rural houses that have a well), the PVB may spit water each time the pump shuts off. This is due to the fact that the pressure variations caused by the pump and pressure tank system can trigger backflow from the watering system back into the water supply.

One method to stop, or a minimum of minimize, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB might still spill a little water with the check valve set up, nevertheless in most cases it need to be much less water.</p>
