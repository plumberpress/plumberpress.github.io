<p>A toilet auger works the opposite way that a plunger does. Rather than dislodging the obstruction with negative pressure, it really pushes into the clog, working further into where the obstruction is happening. The auger or snake" is then used to push the clog out of the drain pipe, leaving a clear path for water to stream easily. The auger's corkscrew-shaped pointer helps force it further down into the clog, making it easier to clear.</p>
