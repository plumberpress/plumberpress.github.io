Damaged and wore away parts make repairs challenging and pricey, implying a faucet installation is more worthwhile. Repairs are the appropriate fix for problems such as missing or harmed washers, aerators, nuts, bolts, and other small components of the whole fixture. If these repairs and replacements do not work or if the repairs cost over 30% of the cost of replacing your faucet, then we recommend a new faucet installation.</p>
