<p>You hear water leaking or running in the tank. A backflow takes place when water runs backwards through your pipes and into the drinking water supply. The water streaming in reverse from a cross-connection might contaminate the drinking water supply. Lawn watering systems, pool, and hot tubs are common cross-connection points.

<p>For shallow pipes without any neighboring utilities or obstructions, digging through and replacing the pipe manually would likely be more affordable than relining it internally. However, if your damaged pipe runs under your driveway, any large trees or pathways, dig-free pipe lining could save you as much as $10,000 in repair expenses, if not more. Set a pail under the P-trap and detach the drains. Then get rid of the sink strainer. Get rid of any excess putty.</p>
