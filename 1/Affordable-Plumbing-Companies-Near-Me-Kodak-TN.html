<p>Caution: If utilized on a water system where a pump and pressure tank provides the water (like is utilized on a lot of rural houses that have a well), the PVB may spit water each time the pump turns off. This is since the pressure variations brought on by the pump and pressure tank system can cause backflow from the watering system back into the water supply. The probability of water spitting, and the amount of water that spits out, both increase with a longer mainline on the watering system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One method to stop, or at least reduce, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB might still spill a little water with the check valve installed, nevertheless in most cases it must be much less water.</p>
<p>A water softener is made up of a mineral tank and a backflush tank. It gathers hardness minerals within its conditioning tank and from time to time flushes them away to drain. Ion exchangers are often used for water softening. When an ion exchanger is looked for water softening, it will replace the calcium and magnesium ions in the water with other ions such as salt or potassium. The outcome of our sophisticated water softener innovation is healthier, smoother water for you and your family, while still keeping an efficient circulation rate.</p>
