<p>Scrape off the old putty with a plastic putty knife so you do not scratch the sink. Seal the new basket in the sink with plumber's putty as displayed in Photo 4. Plumber's putty can not be used on particular brand-new sinks, but these will be identified to that effect. If you can't utilize plumber's putty, use a non-water-based silicone. When you tighten the locknut in place, excess putty will squeeze out in between the new basket strainer and the sink. Wipe it off with a rag or paper towel. Make sure to place the cardboard friction ring in between the rubber gasket and the locknut so the locknut spins freely, without catching on the gasket.</p>
