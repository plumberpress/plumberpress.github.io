It could be in need of significant repairs or it could be nearing the end of its life expectancy if your disposal is frequently making sounds that are unusual for the machine. Regular blockages, even when you're barely washing down any food particles, could suggest a problem with the disposal. It is most likely due to too much usage over a long duration of time if there are leaks coming from your system. A number of these leaks can be fixed, however if they end up being larger and more frequent, you need to think about overall system replacement.</p>
<p>Then connect the drain (and dishwasher hose, if suitable). If your unit is outlet-ready-- take note of this part-- ensure your disposal switch remains in the off" position before you plug the brand-new system in. While it's unlikely that having a disposal launch while your head is pushed against it will result in decapitation, it may terrify a couple of years off your life.
