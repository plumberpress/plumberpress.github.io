<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, however he charged $300 plus tax. Instead of repairing the leak, he wished to replace the whole piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he couldn't just fix the fittings rather of a total replace. He said he would change the washers and that may do it. He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted no further repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there since it wasn't on a load. As quickly as he left, my tenants attempted the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he stated he would not come back due to the fact that he had another consultation. An ideal bad plumber story.</p>
<p>The most basic mechanical backflow prevention device is the vacuum breaker assembly (VBA). It has one moving part, a portable disc connected to an atmospheric vent. In case of a siphon, the pressure in the valve will drop listed below that of the outside air. This sets off the disc to open, permitting air to go into the valve and bring back pressure equivalent to ambient climatic requirement. This remediation of pressure breaks the siphon and avoids cross contamination.</p>
