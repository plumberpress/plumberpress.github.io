<p>As soon as you've found the trip lever you desire, all you really need to do is (THOROUGHLY!) eliminate your tank cover, unhook the existing lever from the flapper, and loosen it from the tank. Take your new journey lever, location it in the hole where your old trip lever was and protect it. Bear in mind that because of the method a lever works, the locknuts for many toilet journey levers will be reverse threaded so make sure you're turning things the correct way. When you have actually protected the journey lever and are ready to hook up your flapper, make sure you've got simply enough slack in the chain to make sure the flapper is sealing tightly over the flush valve yet is still raising all the way when you push down on the journey lever.</p>
