<p>Button Plumbing was excellent. If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and included two new shut off valves under the sink which had always leaked in the past. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were really friendly and got the work done quickly. The cost was rather affordable. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was very happy with their service.</p>
<p>Calcium (Ca2+) and magnesium (Mg2+) ions that cause water solidity can be eliminated fairly quickly by using an ion exchange treatment. Standard water softeners are cation exchange devices. Cations refer to favorably charged ions liquified in the water. Cation exchange includes the replacement of the hardness ions with a nonhardness ion.
