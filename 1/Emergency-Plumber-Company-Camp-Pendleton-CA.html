<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumber In Camp Pendleton CA</h3>
<p>The use of dissimilar metals in the plumbing can result in galvanic corrosion Direct contact in between dissimilar metals will start the formation of a galvanic cell, which is produced whenever 2 different types of metal are conductively linked to each other, and then immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be rusted and an electrical current is created because of the procedure. A common example of this is when galvanized pipe is directly connected to copper pipe. It is likewise worth keeping in mind that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the space in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not completely avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to reduce this direct contact in between the dissimilar metals. A dielectric coupling consists of an insulating material that physically separates contact between the two metals.</p>
<p>Soft water is safe to drink. Throughout the ion exchange process, the resin beads do launch sodium into the water when getting ahold of the hardness minerals. However the amount of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and actually is far less than what is widely pictured. If you have reasonably difficult water, for example five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only including 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended day-to-day sodium consumption. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the amount of sodium included by water softeners is negligible.</p>
