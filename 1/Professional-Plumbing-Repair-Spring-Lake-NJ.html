To get rid of the disposer, support it from listed below and turn the large, 3-tab mounting ring at the top counterclockwise till the unit falls away. Get rid of the rest of the drain assembly by loosening up the three bolts and spying off the keeping ring. Press the drain out through the sink hole and clear away any old caulk or putty.</p>
