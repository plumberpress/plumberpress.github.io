When it's time for replacement, here's how to examine your plumbing system and understand.</p>
<p>The problem of leak can be credited to any variety of factors which can range from the tank is old and worn out, to over-pressurization, in addition to poor maintenance. The hot water heater tank should have some room to account for the expansion that occurs when heating the water. The thermal expansion needs to leave, thus the need for a growth tank to assist manage the pressure. The force exerted by the growth taking place when boiling the water causes the reservoir to break and start leaking if the tank is old and used out. The solution for this is to replace the hot water heater system.</p>

Set a container under the P-trap and disconnect the drains. Then remove the sink strainer. Remove any excess putty.</p>
