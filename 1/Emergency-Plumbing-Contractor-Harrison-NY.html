<p>A testable backflow prevention device has 2 check valves-- generally 2 layers of security.

<h3>Water Heaters & Water Filtering in Harrison New York</h2>
<p>For gas lines that must be run under ground, a special type of black pipe must be used that is coated with a special plastic material that keeps the wetness out.
