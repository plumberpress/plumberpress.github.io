If you are experiencing a leak originating from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or full blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Likewise, ensure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" undiscovered problem. Try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>In some homes, utilizing a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to technique when searching for a feasible option, particularly when basic plunging does not appear to work.

These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is triggering a clog, which can range from the usual suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, small items, dirt, and even roots in cases where cracked pipes on your home draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them efficient, but at the cost of presenting the danger of damage to your house and family.</p>
