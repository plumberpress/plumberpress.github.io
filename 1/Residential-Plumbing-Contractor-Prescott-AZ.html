Bear in mind that since of the way a lever works, the locknuts for a lot of toilet trip levers will be reverse threaded so make certain you're turning things the correct method. When you have actually secured the trip lever and are all set to hook up your flapper, make sure you've got just enough slack in the chain to make sure the flapper is sealing securely over the flush valve yet is still raising all the method when you push down on the journey lever.</p>
