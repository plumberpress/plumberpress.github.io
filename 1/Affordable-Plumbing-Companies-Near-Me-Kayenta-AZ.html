<p>Culpeper House Services supplies professional waste disposal unit solutions throughout Culpeper County. We will provide you with options for repair or replacement and suggest the best service depending upon your particular needs. For double-bowl sinks, the very best way to set about things is to utilize a constant waste disposer set consisting of a discharge tube, baffle tee, and tailpiece. Such kits direct both drains to a single trap. Depending on the area of the stub out, you'll need either an end outlet or center outlet set.</p>
<p>If you don't have a plumber's snake, you can utilize a wire coat hanger by aligning it. Of course, it won't reach as far as a plumber's snake would, but it may be long enough to reach some blockages. If you can reach it, insert it into the kitchen drain or stub pipe to push through or pull out the clog. Beware not to scratch your sink with the wire.</p>
