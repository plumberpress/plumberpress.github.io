<p>Button Plumbing was great. They changed my kitchen faucet and added two new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly dripped in the previous if I shut down the water under the sink. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were really friendly and got the work done rapidly. The cost was quite affordable. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was extremely happy with their service.</p>
<p>Take an example: Say the your heater is 8 years old and you need to work with a plumber for that burner package. The overall repair bill might be in the $300 variety. A gas hot water heater (not counting various plumbing parts) costs $400 to $1200 (electrical hot water heater cost about $400 to $800). That repair bill is almost half the cost of the heater itself, and it's an old heater on its last legs anyway. Choose the new heater.</p>
