Nasty odor: A strong, undesirable odor coming from your drains could show one of two concerns: food blocking the drain, or a bigger issue in your sewage line.</p>
<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, however he charged $300 plus tax. Rather of repairing the leak, he wished to replace the entire piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he could not simply fix the fittings rather of a complete replace. He stated he would change the washers which might do it. He then disconnected the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted no more repair. He called me and said the lead was no longer there since it wasn't on a load. As quickly as he left, my renters tried the sink and it was still leaking. Since he had another appointment, they called him back and he stated he would not come back. A perfect bad plumber story.</p>
