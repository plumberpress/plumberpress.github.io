<h3>Things You Should Do Before Seeking An Emergency Plumbing Repair Service Chambersburg PA</h3>
<p>Most homes or structures that were built in the 1970s typically have galvanized piping. Over time, the plumbing system can wear and the pipes can begin to corrode. This can cause low water pressure and affect the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping includes iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to provide weather defense. As the external finish of zinc starts to erode, the pipe is exposed to water and wetness, triggering the iron to eventually rust.</p>
<p>Water softening refers to the elimination of magnesium, calcium, and other minerals from water. The most popular approach of water softening is through a procedure called ion exchange. During ion exchange, mineral ions are traded for another type of ion-- typically sodium. The result is water that's been successfully softened by getting rid of almost all traces of the minerals that make up hard water.</p>

<p>How does ion exchange work? A physical and chemical  process filters the water through an exchange media known as resin or zeolite. Generally, the resin is a natural or artificial, sand-like product covered with positively charged sodium ions. As the calcium and magnesium liquifies into favorably charged ions, an ion exchange environment is created. The water flows through the system while the resin launches its sodium ions and easily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water draining of the device is now considered soft.</p>
