<p>While the "Big 4" - fill valve, flush valve, flapper, and journey lever - tend to be the main focus of a lot of repairs, there are a lot of other little toilet parts that ought to also be well preserved to help prevent leaks and other toilet problems. For example, if you have a 2 piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your very first line of defense versus leakages between the tank and bowl.
