<p>While the "Big 4" - fill valve, flush valve, flapper, and journey lever - tend to be the main focus of a lot of repairs, there are a lot of other little toilet parts that ought to also be well preserved to help prevent leaks and other toilet problems. For example, if you have a 2 piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your very first line of defense versus leakages between the tank and bowl. As it gets worn, it can start to split and solidify or merely be so squished that it doesn't fill the space as well as it used to, and you end up with water all over the location. Much like with the gasket, often your tank to bowl washers and bolts can end up being rusty or so used that they spring a leak.
