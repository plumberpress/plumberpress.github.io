<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, but he charged $300 plus tax. Rather of repairing the leak, he wanted to replace the entire piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he couldn't just fix the fittings rather of a total replace. He said he would change the washers which might do it. He then disconnected the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he left with no more repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there since it wasn't on a load. As soon as he left, my renters tried the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he said he would not come back because he had another visit. An ideal bad plumber story.</p>
