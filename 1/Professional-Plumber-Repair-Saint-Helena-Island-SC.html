<p>Sewer lines have one important function: bring wastewater out of a house or structure. Although these property owners didn't feel lucky at the time, it was certainly good timing to camera the line prior to collapsing. The pipe remained in good enough shape to reline prior to the issue got worse. Waiting simply wasn't a choice. The line was 12 feet deep and went under a removed garage. At the least, it would have been an extremely expensive alternative.</p>

<p>Your house's drains and pipes quietly eliminate thousands of gallons of wastewater from your house every year without you even providing a reservation. However, when hair, food scraps, feminine hygiene items, toys, and other foreign objects make their way into your drains, they can lead to major problems.
