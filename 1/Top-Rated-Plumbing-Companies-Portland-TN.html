The LADBS application must be submitted and spent for at least two (2) business days prior to the date of the event, AND, after you have obtained all other needed approvals or clearances from all other companies. Garbage disposals can be made of either aluminum or stainless steel. Aluminum is more economical but more prone to leaking and deterioration. Stainless steel blades are likewise more resilient. Individuals with a septic system will need to contact the septic system installer or maker to learn which garbage disposal designs are compatible with their system.</p>
