It is necessary that the plumbing system be turned on very gradually to ensure no damage is done to the piping system. As soon as the system is pressurized, air needs to be removed from the plumbing system. When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system should be checked to ensure no valves were unintentionally left open or did not close properly. As soon as the plumbing system is pressurized, make sure all valves are totally open and inform the water user that the plumbing system has actually been returned to service.</p>
