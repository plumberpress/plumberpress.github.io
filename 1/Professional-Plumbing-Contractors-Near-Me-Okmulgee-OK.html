<h3>What Causes Pipe and Drain Clogs in Okmulgee OK 74447?</h3>
<p>I bought a "Deal" for $200 towards plumbing services. I have a rental and wanted to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and changing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The written price quote to clean 3 sinks and two tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Only one sink drain was even partly clogged. So, considering that I had a "deal" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (consisting of tax) for the one sink drain. I looked up notes from last time I had the precise sink cleaned from another company and it only cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper just cost $118 + tax) which was only 9 months earlier. I feel that costs were increased due to the fact that I had a "Offer". An Angie's list post from March said depending upon the marketplace and intensity of clog, the typical cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Shame on me for not bringing my previous receipt to be sure I wasn't getting price gouged.</p>
<p>In addition to clogged drain repair, you can count on Waldrop for leaking drain repair. In time, the material your drain is made from can begin to corrode, break down, and eventually fracture with regular use, resulting in a leak. If there is water pooling under your sink or damp areas and signs of water damage, you may have a leaking drain. Not just do leaking drains cause water damage, they also result in a big waste of water. A higher-than-normal water costs is typically a sign that you have a plumbing leak someplace.</p>
