<h3>Drainage Pipe in Leechburg Pennsylvania</h2>
<p>Milwaukee, WI - Oct. 12, 2017 - SofTap Water, Inc., a Cincinnati water innovation start-up, and a graduate of The Water Council's BREW Corporate Accelerator program in Milwaukee WI, revealed today they have accomplished an advancement in water softening treatment using a proprietary Surface area Accelerated Condensation (SACr) innovation.

<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, however he charged $300 plus tax. Rather of fixing the leak, he wanted to replace the entire piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he could not simply fix the fittings instead of a complete replace. He stated he would change the washers and that may do it. He then disconnected the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted no further repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there because it wasn't on a load. As quickly as he left, my renters tried the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he stated he would not come back due to the fact that he had another appointment. An ideal bad plumber story.</p>
