<p>In the very first half of the twentieth century, a range of products were utilized for home plumbing. Galvanized steel and cast iron were the most typical metals, while clay was utilized for sewer line piping. Although all these products are resilient in the short-term, they deteriorate over decades. Both galvanized steel and cast iron are susceptible to various types of deterioration. After about fifty years, they'll begin to weaken from deterioration and may place contaminants into the freshwater supply. We suggest changing the steel, clay, and iron pipes in your home. This might not require entirely repiping your house, given that newer products might have already been utilized in some areas, such as the bathroom plumbing. A professional plumber can help you determine precisely what work requires to be done.</p>

However, hard water can cause everything from small inconveniences, like areas on dishes or soap residue, to major problems like a shorter life-span for your hot water heater, dishwasher, and other vital home devices. For these others and factors, a water softener can be a beneficial investment for your house.</p>
<p>We've currently seen what these two terms have in common, so what's the difference between them?

The softener replaces these ions with salt through a process called ion exchange.</p>

<p>It's important to understand that RPZ assemblies, while more reliable, experience much higher pressure and volume loss than double-check assemblies. Fluctuations in line pressure, downstream or upstream, will prompt a properly working RPZ assembly to regularly release small amounts of water. During a backflow condition, a large volume of water will flow from the relief valve. For this reason, RPZ assemblies should not be set up in areas subject to water damage. Sufficient drainage needs to also be provided.</p>
