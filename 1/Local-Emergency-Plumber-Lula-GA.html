If your water heater is over ten years old, it has actually likely lost much of its effectiveness; continuing to repair it, with its regular breakdowns, is not cost-effective in the long run. As a result, we recommend changing your system if it is over 10 years old.</p>
<p>If you have a large bathtub or more that 2 bathrooms, this style hot water heater may make the most sense for you. There are some installation factors to consider, particularly around sizing the gas line and installing the flue vent, but with the ability for a 50-gallon tank to develop more warm water than a basic 80-gallon tank, these things are pretty special. High-efficiency storage is a great alternative for area heating hydronic options too.</p>
