<p>Finally, the most advanced and complex backflow preventer is the decreased pressure zone device. This device includes no less than 5 individually running valves (2 check valves and a differential relief valve sealed at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve acts as a back up system to the other four. Throughout basic water flows at style pressure, the 2 check valves stay open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by particles or if siphonage strikes the connected service pipeline.

<p>Atmospheric Vacuum Breaker - Design GFAVB - The atmospheric vacuum breaker is among the least costly backflow prevention assembly. The GFAVB is a non-testable unit and are good for back siphonage only for non-health hazard or health danger conditions. They need to be installed downstream from any turned off valves and can not be under pressure for more than 12 hours. , if an GFAVB is utilized backflow prevention on a watering system you need to install one GFAVB after every valve for each zone in the system.. It should also be installed a minimum of 6 inches (150 mm) higher than the greatest outlet in the system (some GFAVB producers, and some local officials, need that they be set up 12 inches (300 mm) greater than the highest outlet). Some towns do not enable the use of GFAVB's. These systems will NOT prevent backflow pressure and can just safeguard against back siphonage.</p>
<p>Corrosion: The most common problem is corrosion in the tank and pipes that link to your hot water heater.

This makes building and construction projects quickly the most common cause of backflow problems. Fire fighting is another typical reason for backflow.
