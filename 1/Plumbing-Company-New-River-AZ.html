<p>As water goes through the supply pipes and after that out the faucets, showerheads, icemaker, washing machine, water boiler, heater, and dishwasher, it's leaving hard, crusty mineral deposits. In the beginning, these small deposits are harmless, but over time they build up and ultimately clog pipes, take valves, and plug aerators and showerheads. In extreme cases, hard-water deposits can significantly limit the water flow, which puts excessive pressure on the entire plumbing system.</p>
