<p>Leaks are tricky. With time, the resin beads in the water softener will end up being covered with calcium and magnesium ions, lessening their capability to soften tough water. Through a process called regeneration, water is automatically flushed through the water softener with a concentrated quantity of regenerant. Now the resin beads get the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the firmness on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems include an entire home water filtration with its patented self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the dissolved rock and dirt and sediment are sent down the drain. With the resin beads recharged," the water softener returns to service, offering the whole home with clean, soft water.</p>
<p>Then attach the waste pipe (and dishwasher hose, if appropriate).

<p>Take an example: Say the your heater is 8 years old and you need to work with a plumber for that burner kit. The overall repair expense may be in the $300 range. A gas hot water heater (not counting miscellaneous plumbing parts) costs $400 to $1200 (electric hot water heater cost about $400 to $800). That repair bill is almost half the cost of the heater itself, and it's an old heater on its last legs anyhow. Choose the brand-new heater.</p>
