<p>Our plumbers are licensed, bonded, and guaranteed and satisfy our stiff trust accreditation requirements.

If these repairs and replacements do not work or if the repairs cost over 30% of the cost of replacing your faucet, then we suggest a brand-new faucet installation.</p>
<p>To link a power cable to the brand-new unit, eliminate the electrical cover plate on the bottom of the disposer and sign up with the colored wires found inside with their equivalents in the cord, utilizing wire nuts.
