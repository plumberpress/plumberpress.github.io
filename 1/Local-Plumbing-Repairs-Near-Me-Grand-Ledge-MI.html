<p>Leaks are sneaky. Gradually, the resin beads in the water softener will become covered with calcium and magnesium ions, decreasing their capability to soften tough water. Through a process called regeneration, water is automatically flushed through the water softener with a focused quantity of regenerant. Now the resin beads get the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the firmness on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems include an entire house water filtration with its trademarked self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the liquified rock and dirt and sediment are sent out down the drain. With the resin beads charged," the water softener goes back to service, providing the whole home with clean, soft water.</p>
<p>Sewers, drains and waste piping are looked for correct grading to preserve down flow. The plumbing system is tested for leakages.
