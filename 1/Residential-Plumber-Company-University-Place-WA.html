<p>When the water does not end up being soft enough, one must first consider problems with the salt that is utilized, or mechanical breakdowns of softener components. When these elements are not the cause of the unacceptable water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or possibly even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners get rid of the calcium and magnesium ions found in difficult water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. As soon as all the ions are fully exchanged, the water softener goes through a regrowth procedure to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with brand-new salt ions.</p>
