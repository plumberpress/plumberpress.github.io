<p>Next, recognize that unless your water is incredibly difficult, all the incoming water does not need to be softened. Showers, sinks, and laundry hookups probably should be softened; toilets, outside spigots, and basement sinks can be bypassed. In some cases, you may want to soften the warm water only. Measure the water usage at the designated connections for each individual in the household or use the following table as a guide.</p>

<p>Single flush High Effectiveness Toilets (HETs) utilize 1.28 gallons per flush. The most recent dual flush HET offered by Bonney will use approximately 1.1 gallons per flush.

Proper care and garbage disposal maintenance will keep it running long past its service warranty and keep your drain lines clear.</p>
