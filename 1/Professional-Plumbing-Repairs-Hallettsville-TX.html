<p>Garbage Disposal Installation Fed Up With False Guarantees? Bad Smells - If foul smells are emerging from your drain, this is a clear indication your sink is not effectively draining water. Unpleasant smells are a direct result of waste-build up in your drain piping. When this accumulation accumulates, it can lead to more powerful odors, and more serious piping problems. Without functional draining pipes, extreme pressure can cause your piping system to break and leak resulting in costly water damage.</p>
<p>A malfunctioning waste disposal unit, grease buildup, collected food and more can all contribute to a clogged kitchen sink. The sink is the focal point in the kitchen and when you have a clogged kitchen sink, that will trigger problems. There are a variety of methods homeowners can unclog a kitchen sink, consisting of utilizing a sink plunger, snaking the drain, or utilizing a solution of vinegar and baking soda. For the more severe clogged kitchen sinks, call your local Roto-Rooter plumber.</p>
