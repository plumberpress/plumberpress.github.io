Plumber's putty can not be used on particular new sinks, but these will be labeled to that effect. If you can't utilize plumber's putty, use a non-water-based silicone. Excess putty will squeeze out in between the new basket strainer and the sink when you tighten up the locknut in place. Clean it off with a rag or paper towel. Make certain to place the cardboard friction ring between the rubber gasket and the locknut so the locknut spins easily, without capturing on the gasket.</p>
