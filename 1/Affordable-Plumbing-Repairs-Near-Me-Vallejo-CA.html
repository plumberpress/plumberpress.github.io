<p>Atmospheric Vacuum Breaker - Design GFAVB - The atmospheric vacuum breaker is among the least costly backflow prevention assembly. The GFAVB is a non-testable system and are good for back siphonage just for non-health risk or health hazard conditions. They must be set up downstream from any turned off valves and can not be under pressure for more than 12 hours. If an GFAVB is used backflow prevention on a watering system you must install one GFAVB after every valve for each zone in the system.  It should also be set up a minimum of 6 inches (150 mm) greater than the highest outlet in the system (some GFAVB producers, and some local authorities, need that they be installed 12 inches (300 mm) higher than the greatest outlet). Some towns do not enable the usage of GFAVB's. These units will NOT prevent backflow pressure and can just protect against back siphonage.</p>
