<h3>Blocked Sewer in Ridge NY 11961 - Some Vital Info You Should Know</h3>
<p>I acquired a "Offer" for $200 towards plumbing services. I have a rental and wanted to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and replacing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The written estimate to clean 3 sinks and two tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Just one sink drain was even partially clogged. So, since I had a "offer" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (consisting of tax) for the one sink drain. I searched for notes from last time I had the exact sink cleaned up from another company and it just cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper just cost $118 + tax) and that was just 9 months earlier. I feel that costs were increased because I had a "Deal". An Angie's list article from March stated depending upon the market and severity of clog, the average cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Shame on me for not bringing my previous receipt to be sure I wasn't getting price gouged.</p>
<p>Before installing, your professional will switch off water and electrical energy to the area. Next, the old sink flange is removed and cleaned of any putty residue. Then, a new mounting ring is set up to the bottom of the sink, the sink drain is linked, and the disposal is linked to its mount. In this method, water is treated with a calculated amount of washing soda (Na2CO3) which converts the chlorides and sulphates of calcium and magnesium into their respective carbonates which get precipitated.</p>
