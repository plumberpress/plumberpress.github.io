<p>Your sewer line is one of the most vital parts of your household plumbing - and if it becomes clogged or broken, it could wreak unwanted issues on your residential or commercial property. A home's service line (also called a sewer lateral) ranges from your home to the mainline sewer in the street. In most cases, the homeowner is responsible for maintaining the service line from the house to the curb, and the City is accountable for keeping the mainline sewer and the portion of the service line from the mainline sewer to the curb.</p>
<p>Downspout Drains: These clog with leaves and debris and can stop working to bring water from roofing rain gutters far from your home or business when not effectively kept.

If you have a clogged drain, it is extremely crucial that you do not attempt to unclog it yourself because this could potentially lead to a large leak and more costly repairs.</p>
