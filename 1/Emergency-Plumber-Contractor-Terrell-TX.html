<p>Finally, the most complicated and advanced backflow preventer is the minimized pressure zone device. This device includes no less than five separately running valves (2 check valves and a differential relief valve sealed off at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve serves as a back up system to the other 4. During standard water flows at design pressure, the 2 check valves stay open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by debris or if siphonage occurs to the linked service pipeline. To avoid backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a reliable and sophisticated (if costly) device is best utilized in crucial locations where cross contamination could be a direct danger to life and health.</p>
