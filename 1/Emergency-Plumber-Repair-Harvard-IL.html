<p>Sewer lines have one vital function: carry wastewater out of a home or structure. Although these homeowners didn't feel fortunate at the time, it was certainly great timing to camera the line prior to collapsing. The pipe was in sufficient shape to reline before the problem worsened. Waiting just wasn't a choice. The line was 12 feet deep and went under a detached garage. At the least, it would have been a very costly choice.</p>
<p>Next, inspect the body. Depending upon the size and manufacturer, the bodies can be made of bronze, plastic, stainless steel, cast iron or ductile iron. It is once again important for the repair technician to be aware of the hardness of the products so that their cleaning process is not destructive. In the larger backflow prevention assemblies (2 - 10") the iron bodies will be covered to decrease any scale development or deterioration. It is very important that the repair service technician is delicate to the solidity and kind of the different finishes utilized on iron body systems so as not to damage the protective finishing.</p>

Ion exchange increases the amount of salt in water, in order to reduce its mineral content. Typically, this process includes 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending upon how difficult the water was to begin with. More difficult water will lead to more sodium, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For most people, this boost in salt is minor, however if you have actually been advised by a medical professional to follow a strict low salt diet plan this increase can pose problems.</p>
