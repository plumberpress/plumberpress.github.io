This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have been eliminated-- destructive. For this factor, WQA advises that typical metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) must not be used downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not eliminate the TDS and do not cause this kind of rust A softener is just catching some cations (mostly calcium and magnesium) and launching other cations in the process (normally sodium or sometimes potassium).</p>
