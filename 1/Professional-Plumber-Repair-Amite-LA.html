<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, however he charged $300 plus tax. Instead of repairing the leak, he wanted to replace the entire piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he could not simply fix the fittings instead of a complete replace. He stated he would change the washers which might do it. He then disconnected the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted to no additional repair. He called me and said the lead was no longer there since it wasn't on a load. As quickly as he left, my tenants attempted the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he said he would not return because he had another appointment. A perfect bad plumber story.</p>
<p>Be aware that the majority of kinds of disposals need a switch nearby to the sink to manage the outlet-- the electrical expert ought to wire for this, too. Keep in mind: Batch-feed disposers do not need a switch since they start when you place and turn a special drain plug.
