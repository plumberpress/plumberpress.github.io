<p>Back-siphonage is the reverse from regular flow instructions within a piping system that is triggered by negative pressure in the supply piping (i.e., the reversal of typical circulation in a system brought on by a vacuum or partial vacuum within the water supply piping).

<h3>Four Faucet Problems That Need Faucet Replacement in Fairfield AL 35064</h3>
<p>I purchased a "Deal" for $200 towards plumbing services. I have a rental and wanted to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and replacing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The written price quote to clean 3 sinks and 2 tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Just one sink drain was even partially clogged. So, because I had a "deal" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (including tax) for the one sink drain. I searched for notes from last time I had the exact sink cleaned from another company and it only cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper only cost $118 + tax) and that was just 9 months back. I feel that rates were increased due to the fact that I had a "Offer". An Angie's list article from March said depending upon the market and seriousness of clog, the typical cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Shame on me for not bringing my past receipt to be sure I wasn't getting cost gouged.</p>
