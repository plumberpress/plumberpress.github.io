<h3>Water Heater Installation and Repair Tips at Solon OH 44139</h3>
<p>Many house owners have traditional water heaters that include a tank where hot water is saved. While these are affordable initially buy, they are not the most efficient or reliable way for you to get hot water, particularly if your system is obsoleted. If your hot water heater is more than 8 years of ages, it might be time to think about changing it with a new energy-efficient design. That's where the plumbers at Casteel comes in.</p>
<p>Dry pipe systems typically are installed in large, unheated locations, such as parking lot. These systems have pressurized air or nitrogen in the pipe, which keeps the main dry-pipe valve closed. When a sprinkler triggers due to heat, the air is released, allowing the dry-pipe valve to open, filling the system with water, which is discharged through the open sprinkler head to reduce the fire.</p>
<p>Mold Growth: Mold development is another unfortunate side effect if you need a sewer line fixed. This is most typical when you also have a smell of sewage along with it. The mold development would probably be behind your walls but will begin to seep through with time. You will probably see a white residue on your wall close to an area where a sewer pipe is located.</p>
