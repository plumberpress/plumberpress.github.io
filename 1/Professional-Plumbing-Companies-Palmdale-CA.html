Most of the Valley in truth has some of the worst water in the nation. We rank 3rd for the absolute worst water in the country according to DailyFinance and the Environmental Working Group.

<p>The anode rod in your water heater is designed to draw in corrosion-causing components in the water, helping to avoid the steel tank from wearing away. The very best way to avoid drain clogs is to view what you flush. If you take a look at your house's plumbing pipes and see stains, staining, flaking, little imprints or rust, your pipes are wearing away. Rusting pipes are most likely to spring a leak (if they haven't already) and must be replaced as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Pre-action lawn sprinkler usually are set up in locations where water could cause catastrophic damage, such as in freezers, computer system rooms, and locations with electronic devices. The piping in a pre-action system contains air or nitrogen, which can be pressurized or non-pressurized. Water to the system is held back by the pre-action valve, which is connected to a fire detection system. If a fire occurs, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the pre-action valve, which then allows water into the system's piping. The water is released through the open sprinkler.</p>
<p>Contractors and do-it-yourselfers are responsible for scheduling inspections by calling the workplace number listed on the structure permit.

Anything reading above 80 psi. is a sign of a failing water pressure-reducing device and must be addressed as soon as possible.

Then we can talk about any alternatives that may be available to offer you assurance and guarantee a healthy water supply.</p>
