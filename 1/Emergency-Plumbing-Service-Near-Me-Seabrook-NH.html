<p>Soft water is safe to drink. During the ion exchange process, the resin beads do launch salt into the water when getting ahold of the solidity minerals.

If you have reasonably difficult water, for example 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only adding 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended everyday salt consumption. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the quantity of sodium added by water softeners is negligible.</p>
