<h3>Most Common Plumbing Emergencies North Charleston SC</h3>
<p>A. Usually wax does not "go bad" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to prevent smells. If you are experiencing a leak originating from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or complete blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Also, ensure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" undiscovered issue. Try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>A water softening system might not be the very best solution for each homeowner, especially if you're only aiming to enhance certain aspects of your water, like the taste, rather than addressing firmness in general. Fortunately, there are lots of alternatives available for improving the taste of your water, along with for softening the water to specific devices or components.</p>

<p>Difficult water is brought on by high levels of calcium and magnesium in the water. Water softeners deal with the water by using salt and ion-exchange resins to remove these minerals. When the water comes in contact with the resins, the calcium and magnesium ions transfer out of the water and onto the active websites on the resin. Then they are replaced in the service by the sodium ions.</p>
