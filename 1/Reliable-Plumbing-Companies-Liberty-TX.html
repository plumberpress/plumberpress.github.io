<h3>Plumbing Drainage & Heating Liberty TX</h3>
<p>A newly installed water heater should not produce unusual noises, however it will begin to generate rumbling sounds as it ages. The noises get louder gradually as the heater runs to heat up the water. Things worsen considerably for homes with a high need for hot water. The factors for the noises can be the accumulation of sediments in the tank which should be flushed to restore normalcy. If the water heater still produces rumbling sounds even after it has actually been flushed, a water heater replacement might be necessary.</p>
<p>Insecticide from garden tubes: The highly toxic insecticide chlordane was back-siphoned into the water system. An extermination company employee had left one end of a garden hose in a barrel of diluted insecticide and the other linked to an external home hose bibb (outside spigot). When the water supply system pressure dropped due to repair work, the chlordane was sucked back through your house into the water supply.</p>
