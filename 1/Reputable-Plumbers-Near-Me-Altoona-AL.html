<p>It's Making Noise - As your water heats, there are minerals that are separating and falling to your tank's bottom. This will trigger it to work more difficult and can develop noise. If your energy expenses are rising, a brand-new, greater performance hot water heater can bring them back down. All that has to be done is blocking the inlet and outlet valves of the softener and open up the bypass valve, allowing difficult water to flow to the storage tank and household taps. After that the softener can be disconnected, transferred to its new location and placed there.</p>
<p>You can use a wire coat hanger by aligning it if you do not have a plumber's snake. Naturally, it will not reach as far as a plumber's snake would, but it might be long enough to reach some obstructions. If you can reach it, insert it into the kitchen drain or stub pipe to push through or pull out the clog. Be careful not to scratch your sink with the wire.</p>
