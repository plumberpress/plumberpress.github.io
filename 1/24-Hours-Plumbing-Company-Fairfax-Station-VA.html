<p>Once a large enough source of water has actually been identified and assessed, the 3rd major part of a water supply system comes into play: a system of pipelines to communicate the water from its source to its consumers. The biggest of these primary long-distance transferring pipes are described as aqueducts. Typically built of large-diameter (10 feet or more) reinforced concrete pipe segments, and even tunnels lined with an impenetrable covering, these are huge underground and aboveground pipes designed to bring bulk flow quantities of water to treatment plants, secondary storage centers and circulation nodes where the flows are transferred to smaller-sized branch circulation pipelines. The majority of big cities need numerous aqueducts supplying water from geographically separated and diverse sources.</p>

<p>Lastly, the most complex and advanced backflow preventer is the decreased pressure zone device. This device consists of no less than 5 separately running valves (two check valves and a differential relief valve sealed at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve serves as a back up system to the other four. During standard water streams at design pressure, the two check valves stay open and the relief valve is closed.

<p>Once the hardware parts have been cleaned up and checked and the rubber parts have been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their components. Some elements might have extremely tight tolerances that have to be preserved. A crucial thing to recognize on each element is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the motion or directs of the part. The guide is a very important part of the style of each element. If the component is not fixed properly, the guide could restrict the movement (instead of steady or direct) of the element, which might cause the element to not work to its abilities.
