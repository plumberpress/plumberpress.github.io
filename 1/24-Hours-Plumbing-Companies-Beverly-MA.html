<p>No other room in a house contains as numerous pipes and plumbing fixtures as the bathroom. When replacing an under-sink assembly, look for quality materials. Prevent flex pipe that can be bent into any setup, in addition to flexible rubber traps. Particles can quickly catch in this type of piping while the piping's versatile nature does not provide necessary assistance for the drain basket. PVC assemblies are a good option s they can be easily attached to metal drain pipes. Seal connections with silicone and make sure it sets before testing the drain.</p>
<p>To connect a power cord to the brand-new unit, get rid of the electrical cover plate on the bottom of the disposer and join the colored wires found inside with their equivalents in the cable, using wire nuts. The green ground wire is looped under the green screw on the unit. This can be done at any point prior to installation. Plumbing plans are not required for one- and two-family homes or townhouses, as defined in the California Residential Code, and their accessory structures.</p>
