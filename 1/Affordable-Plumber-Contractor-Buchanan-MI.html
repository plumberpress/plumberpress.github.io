<p>Responsive flow innovation works by continually bringing tanks off-line and online in response to the water demands of your carwash.

However, more tanks come online as the wash bays fill. This responsive design allows the MTS to use up to 50% less salt and 38% less regeneration water than standard single-tank or twin rotating systems.</p>
