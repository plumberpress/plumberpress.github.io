A gas leak can have nearly immediate impacts on those exposed to it, and it can even be fatal. Get out of the home and call us immediately if you've got a gas pipe leaking.</p>
<p>Loose flanges are usually the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws merely won't keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best option depends upon the degree of the rot. Use an ear-type repair ring if the rot is just under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood farther away from the flange. Before you install this type of ring, hold it approximately the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might need to cut off a number of ears to make it deal with your toilet. You'll have to replace a section of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
