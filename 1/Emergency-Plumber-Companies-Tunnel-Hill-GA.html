<p>As soon as a big enough source of water has been identified and examined, the 3rd major element of a water supply system enters into play: a system of pipelines to communicate the water from its source to its customers. The biggest of these main long-distance transmitting pipes are described as aqueducts. Generally constructed of large-diameter (10 feet or more) enhanced concrete pipe sections, and even tunnels lined with an impenetrable covering, these are substantial underground and aboveground pipes created to carry bulk flow amounts of water to treatment plants, secondary storage centers and distribution nodes where the flows are transferred to smaller-sized branch circulation pipelines.

<h3>Drain Plumbing in Tunnel Hill Georgia</h2>
<p>In some neighborhoods, home water softeners drain to community wastewater treatment plants, which are not developed to get rid of chloride.

The softener changes these ions with salt through a process called ion exchange.</p>
