<p>Oxidants such as chlorine in the general public water system respond with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, triggering them to scale, flake, and become breakable. This leads to micro-fractures and reduces the standard structural integrity of the system.

Incorrect installation is also a typical reason for polybutylene system failure, which can be nearly impossible to discover.</p>
