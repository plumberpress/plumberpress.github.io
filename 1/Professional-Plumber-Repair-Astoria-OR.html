<p>City of Bellingham checks backflow assemblies upon installation and carries out periodic re-inspections on all existing assemblies. New assemblies need to be tested by a State of Washington certified Backflow Assembly Tester prior to putting into service. A copy of the test report must be provided to the City of Bellingham. Your water will taste much better. The minerals in difficult water can cause a bad smell and taste. When you include a water softener, it gets rid of the mineral content to produce odor free drinking water that tastes great.</p>
