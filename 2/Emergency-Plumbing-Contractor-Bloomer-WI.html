<p>If you're living with decreased pressure from scale-ridden pipes, dry hair, stiff laundry, and endless home appliance repair bills, you need a water softener. Tough water is not an issue that will disappear by itself and the expenses incurred by hard water will just continue to intensify. With a water softener, appliances will inevitably fail faster than their expected life expectancy. Your circulation rate will continue to limit and you risk losing water pressure throughout the house if scale continues to collect in your pipes. Hard water ravages water heaters, and without a softener, your utility costs will continue to barrel skyward. If your supply of water is hard, the perpetual cycle of repairs and replacements will continue till your house is secured by a water softener.</p>

<p>If there are any lead pipes in the house, find out. Homes that were developed prior to 1986 often have lead or galvanized plumbing. Lead, as you understand, no matter how useful, is an ecological toxin (note the need for unleaded gasoline and paint in homes that is not lead based). You may not desire to live in a house that has lead pipes if you have kids.</p>
<p>Mineral deposits get captured on the sides of a pipe and harden. With time, the deposits build up, until they form a traffic jam that makes it harder for water and waste to travel through your pipes. These deposits happen more regularly when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, since the toilet does not have the power to blast the minerals away from the drain pipe. If you wish to make two times as sure your toilet is the issue prior to you replace it, you could have your drain pipes professionally cleaned. If your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still obstructs, it's time for a new one.</p>
