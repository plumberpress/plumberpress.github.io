<p>Responsive circulation innovation works by continuously bringing tanks off-line and on-line in action to the water needs of your carwash. For instance, in a four-tank MTS setup with responsive flow technology, only one of the 4 tanks is required to soften water when the carwash isn't busy. Nevertheless, more tanks come on-line as the wash bays fill up. This responsive design enables the MTS to use up to 50% less salt and 38% less regrowth water than standard single-tank or twin alternating systems.</p>
<p>Now wait a minute, some people say, does not the water pressure in the water supply keep the watering water from reversing? Yes, most of the time it does. However, there are times when the water pressure drops in the supply system, and this is when the backflow takes place. No, it is not a frequent occurrence, but it does take place more often than you think! When you do not discover the water was off for a few minutes, typically it takes place at night. An example is when the water company needs to shut off the water to repair a water pipe, or attach a brand-new pipe. This makes building tasks easily the most typical cause of backflow problems. Fire battling is another common reason for backflow. Fire engine use substantial pumps to suck the water out of the fire hydrants.
