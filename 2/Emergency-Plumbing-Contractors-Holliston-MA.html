<p>Disadvantages to be aware of is that hybrid water heaters need to be installed in an area that remains in between 40 to 90 degrees, or they will not work well. They need as much as 7 feet of clearance from the floor to ceiling, due to the fact that the heat pump is on top of the hot water heater. Also, hybrids require as much as 1,000 cubic feet of uncooled space to capture adequate heat from the air, and a drain in close proximity to discharge the condensate.</p>
<p>Learn if there are any lead pipes in the house. Residences that were built prior to 1986 often have lead or galvanized plumbing. Lead, as you understand, no matter how helpful, is an environmental toxic substance (note the need for unleaded gasoline and paint in houses that is not lead based). If you have kids, you may not want to live in a home that has lead pipes.</p>
<p>Pro Pointer: If you're going to be draining pipes a dishwasher through the unit, now is the best time to remove the knockout plug inside the dishwasher inlet. Utilize a hammer to tap a screwdriver into the inlet until the plug is broken off; retrieve the small piece of plastic from inside the disposer. This is likewise the perfect time to make the connections for a hardwired system with a pre-existing junction box.</p>
