<p>Finally, the most advanced and complex backflow preventer is the reduced pressure zone device. This device includes no less than five individually running valves (two check valves and a differential relief valve sealed off at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve serves as a back up system to the other 4. During basic water streams at style pressure, the 2 check valves stay open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by particles or if siphonage strikes the connected service pipeline. To avoid backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a advanced and reliable  (if pricey) device is best utilized in important locations where cross contamination could be a direct risk to life and health.</p>
