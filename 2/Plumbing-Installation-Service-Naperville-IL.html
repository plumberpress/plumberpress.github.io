<p>Mineral deposits get captured on the sides of a pipe and harden. Over time, the deposits accumulate, till they form a bottleneck that makes it harder for water and waste to travel through your pipes. These deposits happen more frequently when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, because the toilet doesn't have the power to blast the minerals far from the drain pipe. If you want to make twice as sure your toilet is the issue before you replace it, you could have your drain pipes professionally cleaned. If your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still obstructs, it's time for a brand-new one.</p>
