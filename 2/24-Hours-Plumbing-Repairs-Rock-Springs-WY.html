<p>A. Normally wax does not "go bad" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to avoid odors. If you are experiencing a leak coming from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or full blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Likewise, make certain the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" undiscovered problem. If you aren't sure where the leak is originating from, try putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours.</p>

<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to handle peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to effectively get used to your company' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high circulation demand, tanks come on-line to include circulation rate capability. Throughout durations of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This new method to softening is called progressive or responsive flow technology, and it's perhaps the most essential innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
