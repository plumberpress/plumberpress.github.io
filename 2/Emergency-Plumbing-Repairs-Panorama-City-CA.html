You don't recognize just how much you count on your drains for quality plumbing until they quit working. Provided the important things that constantly decrease them, it's simple for blockages to form. If you're not careful, these blockages can change into higher plumbing problems.</p>
<p>Caution: If utilized on a water supply where a pump and pressure tank provides the water (like is used on many rural houses that have a well), the PVB may spit water each time the pump shuts down. This is because the pressure variations caused by the pump and pressure tank system can cause backflow from the watering system back into the water system. The probability of water spitting, and the amount of water that spits out, both boost with a longer mainline on the watering system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less most likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One method to stop, or at least decrease, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB might still spill a little water with the check valve set up, however most of the times it need to be much less water.</p>
<p>Please let EBMUD know of any situation that might require a backflow device. Often conditions on residential or commercial properties change that may need a backflow device, such as treating a boiler with ingredients or setting up a well with a pump.
