Water temperature level problems can be repaired by changing the temperature level on the water heater. Low water pressure from a sink faucet may be brought on by a blocked aerator screen. House owners can simply unscrew the aerator screen from the faucet to clear out minerals or other deposits. If the shutoff valves under the sink are not open all the method, water pressure can likewise be low.</p>
