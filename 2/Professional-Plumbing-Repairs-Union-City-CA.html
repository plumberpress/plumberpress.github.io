<h3>Most Common Residential Plumbing Emergencies Union City CA</h3>
<p>As the name recommends, a backflow preventer works to guarantee that liquids do not flow back against the needed direction of flow. When used in the context of a fire sprinkler system, a backflow preventer device is used to make sure that water does not stream from the lawn sprinkler back into the municipal water system, or other source of drinking water. Sadly, water kept in the sprinkler system can end up being infected. If allowed to re-enter the water supply, there is potential for the polluted water to become a health threat. The backflow preventer is meant to prevent water flowing back towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be checked regularly for efficiency, along with inspected every year by a fire inspection company in order to ensure they are working as they should.</p>
