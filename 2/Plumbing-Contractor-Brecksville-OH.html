<p>Backflow is water flowing in the opposite instructions from its normal circulation. IRWD's safe and clean water supply is designed to keep the water flowing to you.

This creates a backflow condition and the capacity for polluted water entering the drinkable water distribution system.</p>
<p>Firstly, never plant anything up versus your house, in front of windows, nor close to your lateral. (Your lateral is the significant line from your house to the city line.) You may have a concept of where your lateral is located if you have had plumbing service prior to planting. If you do not understand, invest the minimal cost to have a professional plumber locate the lateral for you so that you do not make the error of planting over, to close, or perhaps dig into and break the line. If you are working with somebody to plant for you, make sure to mark the area of the line with non-toxic gardening chalk or garden safe paint so that he or she will also understand the areas to avoid. Your line will be simple to identify if you have a clean-out.</p>
