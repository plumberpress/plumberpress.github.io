This innovation is more cost effective and lasts longer than typical water softening products such as ion exchange or reverse osmosis," continued Dr. Govind.</p>
<p>In reality, reverse flow testing designed to guarantee that backflow preventers avoid backflow was eliminated from NFPA 25 in 2011. While NFPA recognizes that backflow stays a genuine health issue, it considers avoiding it outside the scope of NFPA 25. Instead, NFPA presumes that local or state requirements will guarantee that backflow preventers are effectively tested by qualified workers.</p>
