<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>Leaks are sneaky. Gradually, the resin beads in the water softener will become covered with calcium and magnesium ions, decreasing their capability to soften tough water. Through a procedure called regrowth, water is instantly flushed through the water softener with a concentrated amount of regenerant. Now the resin beads get the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the solidity on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems feature an entire home water filtration with its trademarked self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the liquified rock and dirt and sediment are sent out down the drain. With the resin beads recharged," the water softener returns to service, providing the entire home with clean, soft water.</p>
<p>Next, check the body. Depending on the size and manufacturer, the bodies can be made of bronze, plastic, stainless steel, cast iron or ductile iron. It is once again important for the repair service technician to be aware of the firmness of the products so that their cleaning process is not harmful. In the bigger backflow prevention assemblies (2 - 10") the iron bodies will be covered to lessen any scale growth or deterioration. It is important that the repair service technician is sensitive to the firmness and type of the different finishes used on iron body units so as not to harm the protective coating.</p>
