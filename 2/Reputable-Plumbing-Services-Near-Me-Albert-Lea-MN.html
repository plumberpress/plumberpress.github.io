<p>In some homes, utilizing a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to approach when searching for a viable option, especially when basic plunging doesn't appear to work. However, there are many disadvantages to utilizing these dangerous products - not least of which is that they normally contain compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is triggering an obstruction, which can range from the usual suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, small things, dirt, and even roots in cases where split pipes on your home draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them effective, but at the cost of presenting the threat of harm to your house and household.</p>
