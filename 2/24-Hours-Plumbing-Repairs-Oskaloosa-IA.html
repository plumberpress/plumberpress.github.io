<p>Backflow is bad news. After an inspection has actually been scheduled using the Permits and Inspections Online Permitting Service scheduling system, inspectors might be called between 8:00 am - 9:00 am the day of the inspection.

There are a few others that I will point out but do not get hung up on them. Since they will be on a certification test, I mention them only.</p>
