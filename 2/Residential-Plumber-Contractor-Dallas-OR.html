<p>How does ion exchange work? A physical and chemical  procedure filters the water through an exchange media called resin or zeolite. Usually, the resin is a natural or synthetic, sand-like product covered with favorably charged salt ions. As the calcium and magnesium liquifies into positively charged ions, an ion exchange environment is produced. The water streams through the unit while the resin launches its salt ions and readily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water draining of the device is now considered soft.</p>
