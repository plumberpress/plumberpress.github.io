<h3>Fix A Leaking Water Pipe in East Rochester NY 14445</h3>
<p>I acquired a "Offer" for $200 towards plumbing services. I have a rental and wished to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and replacing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The written estimate to clean 3 sinks and 2 tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Just one sink drain was even partly clogged. So, given that I had a "offer" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (including tax) for the one sink drain. I searched for notes from last time I had the precise sink cleaned from another company and it only cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper just cost $118 + tax) which was only 9 months earlier. I feel that costs were increased due to the fact that I had a "Deal". An Angie's list short article from March said depending on the marketplace and severity of clog, the average cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Shame on me for not bringing my previous receipt to be sure I wasn't getting cost gouged.</p>
