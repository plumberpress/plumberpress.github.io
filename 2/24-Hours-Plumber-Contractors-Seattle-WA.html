<p>Water that has been entirely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is hungry for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have been eliminated-- destructive. For this factor, WQA suggests that typical metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) ought to not be used downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not eliminate the TDS and do not cause this kind of deterioration A softener is just catching some cations (mainly calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations while doing so (usually sodium or often potassium).</p>
<p>All you truly need to do is (THOROUGHLY!) once you've found the trip lever you want eliminate your tank lid, unhook the existing lever from the flapper, and loosen it from the tank. Take your new trip lever, place it in the hole where your old journey lever was and protect it. Keep in mind that because of the way a lever works, the locknuts for the majority of toilet journey levers will be reverse threaded so make certain you're turning things the proper method. When you've secured the trip lever and are all set to connect your flapper, ensure you've got simply enough slack in the chain to make sure the flapper is sealing tightly over the flush valve yet is still lifting all the way when you push down on the trip lever.</p>
