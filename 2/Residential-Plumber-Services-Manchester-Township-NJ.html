<p>As the name recommends, a backflow preventer works to make sure that liquids do not flow back versus the needed direction of circulation. When utilized in the context of a fire lawn sprinkler, a backflow preventer device is utilized to ensure that water does not flow from the lawn sprinkler back into the local supply of water, or other source of drinking water. Sadly, water kept in the sprinkler system can end up being polluted. If enabled to re-enter the water system, there is potential for the polluted water to become a health hazard. The backflow preventer is planned to avoid water flowing back towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be checked frequently for efficiency, in addition to inspected every year by a fire inspection company in order to guarantee they are working as they should.</p>
