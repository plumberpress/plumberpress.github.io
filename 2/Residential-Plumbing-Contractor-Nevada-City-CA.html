It didn't simply improve and make cleaning simpler, however it assists minimize waste too. Once it has passed through the valve, a backflow prevention assembly is a mechanical valve arrangement created to avoid the reversal of the circulation of water.

Links that are too tight can actually cause leakages or spin the fill valve inside the tank. Check for leakages and tighten them a bit more if required.</p>
