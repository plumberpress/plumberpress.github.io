<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumber Sumrall MS</h3>
<p>Though water line replacement seems like your home's equivalent of major surgery, it's in fact something we at Gotelli Plumbing deal with frequently. When your water lines are repiped, it simply indicates old copper and galvanized pipes are changed with new pipes. We discover that homes 15 years or older who have never had repiping work are the most likely prospects for water line replacement. If you have an older house and are experiencing major and regular leakages, you could be in need of water line repiping. We find that repiping can really be the less expensive and much better long-lasting service if you do have frequent leakages.</p>
