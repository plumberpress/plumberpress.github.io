Ion exchange increases the quantity of sodium in water, in order to decrease its mineral material. Normally, this process includes 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending upon how hard the water was to start with.

For most people, this increase in sodium is small, but if you have actually been encouraged by a medical professional to follow a rigorous low salt diet this boost can present problems.</p>
<p>When the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the inbound drinkable water supply, backpressure backflow in a structure results. Backpressure can be triggered by pumps or temperature level increases in boilers, or if there is a decrease in the water system pressure.

To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A common kind of backflow preventer is the lowered pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
