<p>Changing your flapper might require slightly various steps than we show (Photos 2 and 3). Your flapper might screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. Finding a replacement flapper may be the hardest part of the job if you have an unusual flush valve. To find a suitable replacement, shut off the water, take the old one with you to the home center or hardware shop. (Turn off the water prior to getting rid of the flapper.) You may not discover an identical match, but opportunities are you'll find among the exact same shape and diameter. If not, attempt a plumbing supply store (in the Telephone Directory under Plumbing Products") or search online.</p>
