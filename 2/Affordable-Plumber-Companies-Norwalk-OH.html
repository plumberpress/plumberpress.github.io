<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, but he charged $300 plus tax. Instead of repairing the leak, he wished to replace the entire piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he couldn't simply fix the fittings instead of a total replace. He said he would change the washers which may do it.

As quickly as he left, my occupants tried the sink and it was still leaking. Since he had another consultation, they called him back and he said he would not come back. A best bad plumber story.</p>
