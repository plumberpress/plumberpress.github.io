<p>The brand-new inlets and outlets on the tank don't constantly line up with the old supply lines. Solder in a pair of 45-degree fittings to balance out each line if needed. Also replace the old shutoff valve with a new ball valve while you're at it (Picture 6). Vent diameters are sized according to the heat output of the water heater. You might need to increase or decrease the vent size to ensure the best draft. CARE: If you're unsure if your chimney has a liner, ask your plumbing inspector.</p>

Therefore, softened water must also be destructive, ideal? This is a misconception because naturally soft water tends to be corrosive due to low pH and low TDS, while cation -exchange softening triggers neither of these conditions.</p>
