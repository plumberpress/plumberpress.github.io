<p>Circulation pipes transition to even smaller sized individual service pipes, carrying water to specific houses, apartment or condo buildings, shops and businesses. Depending on need, these pipes vary in size from a half inch in diameter to 6 inches. Water goes into the consumer facility via a water meter that tape-records circulation rates and water usage for billing purposes.

Worn impellers on older disposals can end up being inefficient, increasing the risk of drain clogs.</p>
