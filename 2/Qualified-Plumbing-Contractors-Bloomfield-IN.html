<p>Tankless systems last 5-10 years longer than tanked systems and need less repairs gradually.

Throughout regeneration, salted water from the brine tank streams up the fill tube and into the softener tank. A rinse cycle commences and the salty water washes the mineral deposits off the resin beads. The regenerated water and the mineral deposits are flushed out the discharge hose. The system then reverts back to softening the inbound water.</p>

Place on a gas mask considering that inhaling such gases is risky for your respiratory system. Ensure to use gloves as well.
