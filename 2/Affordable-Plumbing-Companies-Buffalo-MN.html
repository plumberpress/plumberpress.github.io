<p>Another disadvantage of water softening through ion exchange is the possible health threat for individuals on low sodium diets. Ion exchange increases the quantity of sodium in water, in order to lower its mineral material.

Harder water will result in more sodium, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this boost in sodium is small, but if you've been recommended by a doctor to follow a strict low sodium diet plan this increase can pose problems.</p>
