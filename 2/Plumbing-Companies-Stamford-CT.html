<h2>Tips To Hire Plumbing Contractor in Stamford</h2>

<p>Leaks are tricky. With time, the resin beads in the water softener will end up being covered with calcium and magnesium ions, diminishing their capability to soften hard water. Through a process called regrowth, water is automatically flushed through the water softener with a concentrated quantity of regenerant. Now the resin beads get the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the hardness on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems feature a whole house water filtration with its trademarked self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the liquified rock and dirt and sediment are sent out down the drain. With the resin beads charged," the water softener goes back to service, offering the whole home with clean, soft water.</p>
