The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by particles or if siphonage occurs to the linked service pipeline. To avoid backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a reliable and advanced (if pricey) device is best utilized in vital areas where cross contamination might be a direct risk to life and health.</p>
