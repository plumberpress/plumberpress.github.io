<p>Hydro jetting is a process in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at up to 3,500 PSI. This allows the sewer lines to be cleaned quickly and effectively with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, giving off from the forward and reverse jets in the nozzle, move the hose through the line to remove particles such as hard water scale, grease, silt, and sand deposits.</p>

Nevertheless, there are times when the water pressure drops in the supply system, and this is when the backflow occurs. No, it is not a regular incident, however it does take place more frequently than you think! Often it takes place in the evening when you don't notice the water was off for a couple of minutes. An example is when the water company needs to shut off the water to repair a pipes, or attach a new pipe. This makes building jobs quickly the most common cause of backflow problems. Fire battling is another typical reason for backflow. Fire trucks utilize substantial pumps to suck the water out of the fire hydrants. This frequently causes the water pressure in the surrounding areas to drop, and backflow will take place in the surrounding communities.</p>
