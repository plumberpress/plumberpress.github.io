<h3>Best Gas Tankless Water Heater - Indoor Vs. Outdoor Installation in Mcdonough GA 30253</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Instead of a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to manage peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to efficiently adjust to your business' flow rates throughout the day. During periods of high circulation demand, tanks come online to include flow rate capability. Throughout periods of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This new technique to softening is called responsive or progressive flow innovation, and it's probably the most important innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
