<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to deal with peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently get used to your organisation' circulation rates throughout the day. During durations of high flow need, tanks come online to add flow rate capacity. Throughout durations of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This new approach to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation innovation, and it's arguably the most essential development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
