We find that homes 15 years or older who have never ever had repiping work are the most likely prospects for water line replacement.

If you do have regular leakages, we find that repiping can actually be the more affordable and better long-term option.</p>

If your kit only includes a waste arm, it is possible - though not advised - to link this to the disposer discharge elbow using a slip joint.
