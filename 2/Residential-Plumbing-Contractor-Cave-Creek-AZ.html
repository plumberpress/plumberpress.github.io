A gas hot water heater (not counting various plumbing parts) costs $400 to $1200 (electric water heaters cost about $400 to $800).

<p>Soft water is safe to consume. During the ion exchange process, the resin beads do release salt into the water when getting ahold of the solidity minerals. But the amount of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and really is far less than what is commonly imagined. If you have reasonably tough water, for instance five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only adding 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended day-to-day sodium consumption. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the quantity of salt included by water softeners is minimal.</p>
