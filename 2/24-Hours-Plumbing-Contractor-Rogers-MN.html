<p>When compared to gas designs, electric designs are much easier and cheaper to install as electrical energy is already readily available through the main power supply line. For gas water heaters, a specific gas line needs to be installed and a practical source of gas developed. Another function of an electric water heater is that they do not require any ventilation. Gas designs need to be aerated correctly utilizing vents and ducts in order to function correctly. With electric models, you will not have to install any brand-new vents or ducts in your home.</p>
<p>One sure indication that you may need a gas line repair is if there is a really strong, rotten egg-like smell that you just can't pinpoint, it might be time to get in touch with Mr. Rooter Plumbing.
