<p>Passive Purge - Up to 2007, some houses were allowed to forego a physical backflow device in lieu of a system where stagnant water was purged from the system with usage of one or more toilets in the home. Normally, the water supply to one of the upper floor toilets was piped from the fire sprinkler system; upon each usage, fresh water was introduced into the fire sprinkler system.</p>
<p>When you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes, the normal service is to have the malfunctioning pipes replaced. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes changed, which is where whole-house repiping is available in. This is an option to consider if you live in an older home - such as one developed pre-1970 - or any house with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular option for house plumbing for many decades, however steel eventually suffers from corrosion and does not have the resilience of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
