<p>We focus on storm drain inspections and cleaning. Most kitchen sink clogs are because of heavy grease buildup and food particles. So, scrape those plates in the trash and use the disposal for the small particles that are left. Run cold water while running the disposal and you can depend on clear pipes and fresh smelling drains. Explore our water softener collection and take pleasure in much better water for bathing and devices.</p>
<p>Light Blue = Reduced Pressure Zone - supply pressure presses open the # 1 check and is reduced by the # 1 Check spring (for example, to 90 psi). This pressure distinction across the # 1 check valve maintains the relief valve in the closed position. If pressure in the Zone rises toward the supply pressure (within 2 to 3 psi), the Relief Valve discharges, avoiding backflow (reverse motion of fluid).</p>
