<p>Yes, anywhere connections are or can be made in between the potable supply of water and non-potable water or substances a backflow assembly is needed to be installed. An approved, correctly installed and maintained backflow assembly basically gets rid of the danger of backflow from either backpressure or backsiphonage. Make certain that the softener is filled with salt or potassium chloride following the maker's recommendations.</p>
<p>Oregon state laws governing water systems require backflow prevention assemblies to be installed on water services where cross connections can not be gotten rid of. Backflow assemblies are needed to be installed on the water service connections to all fire sprinkler and landscape sprinkler systems. The law likewise requires backflow assemblies in commercial facilities such as mortuaries and healthcare facilities, as well as industrial centers.</p>
<p>The area under your kitchen sink has gotten more congested throughout the years. Originally, there would have been a hot and cold  water line going up to the faucet (usually with shut-off valves for each) and a single drain pipe with a curved trap. Using liquid epoxy-resin solutions, trenchless technicians can cure in-place whole new areas of pipe within your harmed line, through little and even pre-existing entry points.</p>

<p>The brand-new inlets and outlets on the tank don't constantly line up with the old supply lines. Solder in a set of 45-degree fittings to balance out each line if necessary. Also replace the old shutoff valve with a new ball valve while you're at it (Photo 6). Vent sizes are sized according to the heat output of the water heater. You may need to increase or reduce the vent size to ensure the best draft. CARE: If you're unsure if your chimney has a liner, ask your plumbing inspector.</p>
<p>Pull the two lines out of the trimmer, one at a time. Dispose of the damaged fuel lines. When you pull the fuel lines from the trimmer, a little round fuel line filter will pop off the thin line leading into the tank. Lay it aside so you can reattach it to the new line throughout installation. Less parts in the unit lead to less tankless water heater repair visits.</p>
