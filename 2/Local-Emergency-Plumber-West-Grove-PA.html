<p>Our experienced professionals have numerous systems and tricks of the trade that can really reduce the influence on the house and avoid much of the wall and tile repair. From threading pipes through existing holes to specially designed cover plates for shower valves, it might not be as invasive as you might think. That being stated, there are, obviously, often times when we will be opening a wall to access piping. Fortunately is that we can include wall repair in our scope so that you are not left looking for several contractors to get the task completed.</p>
<p>Repipers start by covering floors and furnishings to safeguard them from water damage and dust during the work. They then locate the pipes in your walls with little cuts into the drywall of the ceilings and walls. They will only eliminate as much building product as required to reach, separate, and remove the old pipe and replace it with new copper, PEX, or CPVC piping. To access pipes in the floor, plumbers will, whenever possible, go in through the ceiling below it. You can organize to have extra pipes put in at this time if you need to broaden your water service for a remodel if you wish.</p>
