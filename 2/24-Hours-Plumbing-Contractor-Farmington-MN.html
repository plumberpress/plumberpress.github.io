If your hot water heater is over 10 years old, it has actually likely lost much of its performance; continuing to repair it, with its regular breakdowns, is not cost-effective in the long run. As a result, we suggest replacing your unit if it is over ten years old.</p>

Tough water typically leaves lime and calcium buildup which can become rather unpleasant.
