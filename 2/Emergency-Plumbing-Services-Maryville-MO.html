The auger's corkscrew-shaped idea helps require it even more down into the clog, making it easier to clear.</p>

<p>In the typical repair, the old rubber parts must be gotten rid of and changed with brand-new rubber parts. When putting the backflow prevention assembly back together whether they are hardware or rubber parts, it is important that just original factory repair parts are used. The rubber parts the maker produces for the assembly are the only ones the assembly was created to utilize and altering the rubber from the original factory parts will impact the operation of the backflow prevention assembly and void any approvals.</p>
