Remember, if you can't remove a drain clog after a couple of efforts on your own, give us a call to help, and we can get it done without completely damaging your fixtures and pipes.

<p>Backpressure backflow in a building results when the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the inbound drinkable supply of water. Backpressure can be triggered by pumps or temperature level boosts in boilers, or if there is a reduction in the water system pressure. Backsiphonage happens when unfavorable or decreased pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, typically due to a disruption or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or neighboring firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A common type of backflow preventer is the lowered pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
