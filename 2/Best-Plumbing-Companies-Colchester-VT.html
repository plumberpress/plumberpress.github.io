<p>While the "Big 4" - fill valve, flush valve, flapper, and trip lever - tend to be the main focus of a lot of repairs, there are lots of other small toilet parts that should likewise be well maintained to assist avoid leakages and other toilet troubles. For example, if you have a 2 piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your very first line of defense versus leakages in between the tank and bowl.
