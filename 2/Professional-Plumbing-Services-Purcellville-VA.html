<h3>How To Keep Bathroom Sinks Running Smoothly in Purcellville VA 20132</h3>
<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one must initially consider problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical malfunctions of softener elements. When these aspects are not the cause of the unsatisfactory water softening, it might be time to replace the softener resin, or maybe even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners remove the calcium and magnesium ions found in hard water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions. As soon as all the ions are totally exchanged, the water softener goes through a regrowth process to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with brand-new sodium ions.</p>
