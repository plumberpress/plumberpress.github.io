Though this is completely regular, it doesn't make it any less bothersome. When you find yourself in need of repiping in Oakland or Alameda, provide the team at Big Blue Plumbing a call.</p>
<p>Some jurisdictions also enable alternatives to backflow preventers. For instance, Philadelphia's water district needs all residential systems supplying devoted sprinkler heads to have a connection from the lawn sprinkler to the toilet tank that's farthest from the supply of water. This eliminates the need for a backflow preventer, since each time that toilet is flushed, it draws water through the fire line to keep the water fresh.</p>
