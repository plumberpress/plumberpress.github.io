<p>The Plumbing Inspections group is consisted of 6 State of Ohio-certified plumbing inspectors, one of which is also works as the Supervising Inspector and the Plumbing Strategy Examiner for the group. Howard, the Job Supervisor, has always been handy and useful relating to all our concerns. He did the proposal and scheduled the work for the clear out and partial sewer line repair immediately. It is always an enjoyment to work with him. Derek snaked the laundry line and outside kitchen sink line which has a "Y". He had the ability to get a snake around the "Y", which many plumbers state they can't do, and clear the line. He is always pleasant, professional and goes above and beyond.</p>
<p>Homeowners frequently bypass maintenance and care for their garbage disposal. When we require it, we merely expect this workhorse positioned under the sink to work as planned. That's not the case, however. Like any good plumbing system, the waste disposal unit requires attention-- preferably, professional care. With our financing options through GreenSky - a leading provider for funding home comfort systems like heating systems, a/c unit, and even plumbing repairs - our consumers can receive our professional service and premier products.</p>

<p>If you're dealing with decreased pressure from scale-ridden pipes, dry hair, stiff laundry, and endless home appliance repair bills, you need a water softener. Tough water is not a problem that will disappear by itself and the costs incurred by hard water will only continue to intensify. With a water softener, home appliances will undoubtedly stop working sooner than their anticipated life expectancy. Your flow rate will continue to limit and you run the risk of losing water pressure throughout the house if scale continues to accumulate in your pipes. Difficult water ravages water heaters, and without a softener, your energy costs will continue to barrel skyward. The perpetual cycle of replacements and repairs will continue till your house is safeguarded by a water softener if your water supply is hard.</p>
<p>Wire the disposal. Some disposals come with device wires connected, and others do not. Remove the cover plate below the disposal and connect the wires according the manufacturer's directions if yours doesn't. Most basic disposals have you attach white wires to white wires and black wires to black wires. When you're finished, screw the cover plate back on.</p>
<p>Then, advanced hydro-jetting and rodding tools are utilized to clear out the most difficult buildup and blockages. When drain cleaning isn't enough, we can also carry out trenchless sewer line repair without digging up your home's lawn. We are all licensed plumbers here. We specialize in residential service & repair, re-piping, warm water boilers and radiant heat systems.</p>
