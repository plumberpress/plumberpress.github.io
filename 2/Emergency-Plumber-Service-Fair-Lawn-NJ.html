<p>How does ion exchange work? A chemical and physical procedure filters the water through an exchange media referred to as resin or zeolite. Typically, the resin is a artificial or natural , sand-like material coated with favorably charged salt ions. As the calcium and magnesium dissolves into positively charged ions, an ion exchange environment is developed. The water flows through the system while the resin releases its salt ions and easily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water draining of the device is now thought about soft.</p>
<p>To get rid of the smells, first try pouring BioSmart (readily available at WJ McNabb Plumbing) down your drain. You can likewise attempt 1 cup lemon juice down the drain.
