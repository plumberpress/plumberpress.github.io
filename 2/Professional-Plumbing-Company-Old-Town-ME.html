<p>Milwaukee, WI - Oct. 12, 2017 - SofTap Water, Inc., a Cincinnati water innovation start-up, and a graduate of The Water Council's BREW Corporate Accelerator program in Milwaukee WI, revealed today they have attained a breakthrough in water softening treatment using an exclusive Surface Accelerated Crystallization (SACr) technology. SACr physically gets rid of short-term hardness without utilizing chemicals or high pressure, which are significant restrictions of current softening innovations.</p>
<p>Some property owners may consider water softeners as a high-end product, something that's great to have" however not altogether needed. However, hard water can cause everything from small annoyances, like areas on meals or soap residue, to major problems like a shorter life-span for your water heater, dishwasher, and other necessary house devices.

<p>Take an example: Say the your heater is 8 years of ages and you need to hire a plumber for that burner kit. The overall repair expense might remain in the $300 variety.
