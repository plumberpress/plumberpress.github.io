<p>Water that has actually been entirely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is starving for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have been gotten rid of-- corrosive. For this reason, WQA advises that common metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) needs to not be utilized downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not remove the TDS and do not cause this type of deterioration A softener is merely catching some cations (mainly calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations in the process (usually sodium or in some cases potassium).</p>
