Customers buying a brand-new home or experiencing regular sewer backups might wish to purchase an extra pipeline camera inspection to have a complete understanding of the condition of the homes plumbing and main drain line.</p>
<p>Do yourself a favor and buy a flexible water system line. They're a lot easier to install than stiff metal or plastic tubing. Make sure to get one that's covered with stainless-steel mesh. For a good seal, hold the hose so it aims directly into the shutoff or fill valve while you're screwing on the connectors. Make them handtight, then add another quarter turn with pliers.
