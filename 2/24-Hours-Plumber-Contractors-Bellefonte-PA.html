<p>Will sears install my garbage disposal for me. Polyethylene piping also makes for a effective and fast replacement task.

<p>Your disposer may feature a thin rubber gasket to be utilized under the sink flange, rather of the conventional plumber's putty as laid out below. Both will create a great seal (though the gasket may lead to small amounts of water collecting around the flange), and what's used is mainly a matter of preference. Some even choose silicone sealant, though it's more difficult to remove.</p>
<p>Galvanized piping is responsible for at least half of the plumbing emergencies that we face in your homes around the Bay Area.
