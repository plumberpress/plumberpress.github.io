<h3>Tips For Finding A Cheap Plumber East Saint Louis IL</h3>
<p>The new inlets and outlets on the tank do not always line up with the old supply lines. Solder in a set of 45-degree fittings to balance out each line if essential. Likewise replace the old shutoff valve with a brand-new ball valve while you're at it (Image 6). Vent sizes are sized according to the heat output of the water heater. You may need to increase or reduce the vent size to ensure the best draft. CARE: If you're not sure if your chimney has a liner, ask your plumbing inspector.</p>
<p>Soft water is safe to drink. Throughout the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do release salt into the water when grabbing ahold of the hardness minerals. But the quantity of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and in fact is far less than what is widely envisioned. If you have reasonably hard water, for example five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only adding 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested day-to-day sodium consumption. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the amount of sodium added by water softeners is negligible.</p>
