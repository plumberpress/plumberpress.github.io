During a camera inspection, a sewer and drain service technician runs a video cable down sewer branch lines that lead from bath tubs, sinks, and other drains into the main sewer line. Using the images captured by the camera, we can determine any sewer and drain line problems, such as obstructions, tree root invasion, misaligned joints, fractures, and other damage.</p>
