<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to deal with peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to efficiently adapt to your service' flow rates throughout the day. During periods of high flow demand, tanks come on-line to add flow rate capability. Throughout periods of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This brand-new method to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation technology, and it's probably the most important innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
