<h3>Three Ways To Find An Emergency Plumber Near Me Winchendon MA</h3>
<p>A. Typically wax does not "spoil" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to prevent smells. If you are experiencing a leak originating from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or full blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Also, make sure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" unnoticed problem. Try putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>Insecticide from garden tubes: The highly harmful insecticide chlordane was back-siphoned into the water supply. An extermination company employee had actually left one end of a garden hose in a barrel of diluted insecticide and the other linked to an external house hose bibb (outdoors spigot). When the water system system pressure dropped due to repair work, the chlordane was sucked back through your home into the water supply.</p>
