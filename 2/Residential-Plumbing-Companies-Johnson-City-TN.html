<p>Leaks are tricky. In time, the resin beads in the water softener will end up being covered with calcium and magnesium ions, decreasing their capability to soften hard water. Through a process called regeneration, water is immediately flushed through the water softener with a focused amount of regenerant.

WaterBoss water softener systems feature a whole home water filtration with its patented self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the liquified rock and dirt and sediment are sent down the drain. With the resin beads charged," the water softener goes back to service, offering the whole house with clean, soft water.</p>
