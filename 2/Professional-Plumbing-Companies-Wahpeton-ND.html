<p>The brand-new inlets and outlets on the tank don't constantly line up with the old supply lines. Solder in a set of 45-degree fittings to balance out each line if needed. Likewise replace the old shutoff valve with a new ball valve while you're at it (Picture 6). Vent diameters are sized according to the heat output of the hot water heater. You may need to increase or reduce the vent size to guarantee the best draft. CAUTION: If you're not sure if your chimney has a liner, ask your plumbing inspector.</p>
