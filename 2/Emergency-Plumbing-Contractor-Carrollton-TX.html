Many people don't generally give much thought to their kitchen sinks, unless they are supporting or leaking. In fact, when redesigning a kitchen, the sink is often the last factor to consider.</p>
<p>How does ion exchange work? A physical and chemical  procedure filters the water through an exchange media called resin or zeolite. Typically, the resin is a artificial or natural , sand-like product covered with positively charged sodium ions. As the calcium and magnesium dissolves into favorably charged ions, an ion exchange environment is produced. The water streams through the unit while the resin releases its salt ions and easily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water draining of the device is now considered soft.</p>
