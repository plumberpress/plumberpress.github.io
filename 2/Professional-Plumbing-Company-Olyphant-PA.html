<p>The brand-new inlets and outlets on the tank do not constantly line up with the old supply lines. Solder in a pair of 45-degree fittings to balance out each line if needed. Also replace the old shutoff valve with a new ball valve while you're at it (Photo 6). Vent diameters are sized according to the heat output of the water heater. You may need to increase or reduce the vent size to guarantee the best draft. CARE: If you're unsure if your chimney has a liner, ask your plumbing inspector.</p>

Some small obstructions can be looked after with a plunger and often, when the toilet will not stop running, it's an easy matter of changing the chain on the flapper valve inside the tank. However, specific concerns do require a skilled plumber, and it's important to understand the distinction to avoid lost time, money, and disappointment.</p>
