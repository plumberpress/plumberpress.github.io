<p>The concern of leakage can be attributed to any variety of elements which can vary from the tank is old and worn out, to over-pressurization, along with bad maintenance. When heating the water, the water heater tank must have some room to account for the growth that takes place.

If the tank is old and worn out, the force put in by the growth happening when boiling the water causes the tank to break and start leaking. The remedy for this is to replace the water heater unit.</p>
