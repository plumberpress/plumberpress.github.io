<p>A garbage disposal resolves all of those problems, including convenience. Simply switch on water at the sink and the garbage disposal does the rest - and much more silently than you believe.

<p>Mineral deposits get captured on the sides of a pipe and harden. In time, the deposits accumulate, until they form a traffic jam that makes it harder for water and waste to go through your pipes. These deposits occur more regularly when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, due to the fact that the toilet does not have the power to blast the minerals far from the drain pipe. You might have your drain pipes professionally cleaned if you desire to make twice as sure your toilet is the issue prior to you replace it. It's time for a brand-new one if your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still clogs.</p>
