<p>As soon as you've discovered the trip lever you desire, all you truly need to do is (THOROUGHLY!) eliminate your tank lid, unhook the existing lever from the flapper, and unscrew it from the tank. Take your new trip lever, location it in the hole where your old journey lever was and secure it. Keep in mind that because of the method a lever works, the locknuts for many toilet trip levers will be reverse threaded so make certain you're turning things the appropriate method. When you've protected the trip lever and are prepared to link your flapper, make sure you've got just enough slack in the chain to ensure the flapper is sealing securely over the flush valve yet is still lifting all the way when you lower on the journey lever.</p>
