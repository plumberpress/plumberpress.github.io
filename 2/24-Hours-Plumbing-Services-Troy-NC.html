<h3>No Hot Water - No Problem, Fix Yourself in Troy NC 27371!</h3>
<p>I purchased a "Deal" for $200 toward plumbing services. I have a rental and wished to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and changing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The composed price quote to clean 3 sinks and two tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Just one sink drain was even partially clogged. So, considering that I had a "offer" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (including tax) for the one sink drain. I searched for notes from last time I had the exact sink cleaned up from another company and it just cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper just cost $118 + tax) which was just 9 months earlier. I feel that costs were increased since I had a "Offer". An Angie's list post from March said depending upon the market and severity of clog, the average cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Embarassment on me for not bringing my past invoice to be sure I wasn't getting cost gouged.</p>
<p>Non-precipitating water softeners are now based on polymer type active ingredients such as salt polycarboxylate. Faulty Parts: If your toilet will not stop running, it's likely due to problems with a toilet tank part. In such cases, we are typically able to replace that single part. InSinkErator is a top quality and trusted brand name that continues to satisfy Costs Howe Plumbing customers. The InSinkErator disposal series consists of the Badger and Advancement series to provide a service for any residential or commercial need.</p>
