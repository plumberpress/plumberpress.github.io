<p>A. Typically wax does not "go bad" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to prevent smells. If you are experiencing a leak originating from below the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or full blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Also, make sure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" undetected problem. If you aren't sure where the leak is coming from, try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours.</p>
