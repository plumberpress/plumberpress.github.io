There are a few things you must understand if you are on the fence about buying one.</p>
<p>Light Blue = Reduced Pressure Zone - supply pressure presses open the # 1 check and is reduced by the # 1 Inspect spring (for instance, to 90 psi). This pressure difference throughout the # 1 check valve keeps the relief valve in the closed position. If pressure in the Zone increases toward the supply pressure (within 2 to 3 psi), the Relief Valve discharges, preventing backflow (reverse movement of fluid).</p>
