<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, however he charged $300 plus tax. Rather of fixing the leak, he wished to replace the entire piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he could not just fix the fittings instead of a total replace. He said he would change the washers and that might do it. He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted to no further repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there since it wasn't on a load. As soon as he left, my renters tried the sink and it was still leaking. Because he had another appointment, they called him back and he stated he would not come back. An ideal bad plumber story.</p>
<p>The typical time to replace a garbage or install disposal varies from 2 to 3 hours. A handyman charges $25 and $45 per hour while plumbers charge $45 and $100 per hour. The rust inside the pipe can break off and be carried out through the taps. This will cause your water to look rusty or brown, and the water may have a bad or nasty odor to it.
