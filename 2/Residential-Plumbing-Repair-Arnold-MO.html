Instead of repairing the leak, he wished to replace the whole piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he couldn't just fix the fittings instead of a total replace. He said he would change the washers and that may do it. He then disconnected the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted no additional repair. He called me and said the lead was no longer there since it wasn't on a load. As quickly as he left, my occupants tried the sink and it was still leaking. Due to the fact that he had another visit, they called him back and he said he would not come back. A perfect bad plumber story.</p>
