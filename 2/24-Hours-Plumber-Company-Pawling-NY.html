<p>Every reasonable buyer inspects a minimum of several things prior to making a down payment on a house. As you may be aware that the water quality here is pretty bad. But are you mindful just how bad? The majority of the Valley in fact has some of the worst water in the country. We rank 3rd for the outright worst water in the nation according to DailyFinance and the Environmental Working Group. Having bad water comes naturally, we do live in a desert after all. In truth the water you shower with, brush your teeth, and even consume has a chlorine level that is perfect for swimming pools. We have 300% more chemicals that surpass nationwide health guidelines, and a even high portion of toxins in our water that the national average. On top of that our average water firmness level is in between 18-23 grains per gallon of water or for simpleness reasons "extremely difficult water".</p>
