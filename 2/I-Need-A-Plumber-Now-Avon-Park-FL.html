<h2>Tips To Hire Certified Plumbing Company in Avon Park</h2>

<p>Leakages are tricky. Over time, the resin beads in the water softener will become covered with calcium and magnesium ions, reducing their capability to soften tough water. Through a procedure called regeneration, water is automatically flushed through the water softener with a concentrated amount of regenerant. Now the resin beads pick up the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the hardness on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems feature a whole house water filtration with its trademarked self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the dissolved rock and dirt and sediment are sent down the drain. With the resin beads charged," the water softener goes back to service, offering the entire house with clean, soft water.</p>
