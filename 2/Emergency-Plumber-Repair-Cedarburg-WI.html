<p>Leaks are sly. In time, the resin beads in the water softener will end up being covered with calcium and magnesium ions, decreasing their capability to soften hard water. Through a process called regeneration, water is immediately flushed through the water softener with a focused amount of regenerant. Now the resin beads get the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the solidity on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems include an entire home water filtration with its patented self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the dissolved rock and dirt and sediment are sent down the drain. With the resin beads recharged," the water softener returns to service, supplying the entire house with clean, soft water.</p>
