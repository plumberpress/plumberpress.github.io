Ion exchange increases the amount of salt in water, in order to lower its mineral content. Normally, this procedure adds 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending upon how tough the water was to start with. More difficult water will result in more sodium, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this increase in salt is small, but if you have actually been encouraged by a physician to follow a stringent low sodium diet plan this boost can position problems.</p>
