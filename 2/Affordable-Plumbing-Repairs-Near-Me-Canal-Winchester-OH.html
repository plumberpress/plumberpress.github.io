This innovation is more cost efficient and lasts longer than common water softening products such as ion exchange or reverse osmosis," continued Dr. Govind.</p>
<p>Eventually, nevertheless, the beads reach maximum capacity and can't attract anymore mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank must be restored, or, flushed clean. That's where the brine tank can be found in. An on-board computer system calculates the quantity of water that flows through the softener.
