It is important that the plumbing system be turned on very gradually to ensure no damage is done to the piping system. When the system is pressurized, air needs to be removed from the plumbing system. Each outlet on the plumbing system need to be inspected to make sure no valves were inadvertently left open or did not close properly when re-pressurized.
