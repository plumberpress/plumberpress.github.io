<p>Button Plumbing was great. If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and included two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had always dripped in the past. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were extremely friendly and got the work done quickly. The rate was quite sensible. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing needs. I was very delighted with their service.</p>
