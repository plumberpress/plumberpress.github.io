<h3>Clearing Blocked Drains in Honesdale PA 18431</h3>
<p>I bought a "Offer" for $200 toward plumbing services. I have a rental and wanted to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and changing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The composed estimate to clean 3 sinks and 2 tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Just one sink drain was even partially clogged. So, considering that I had a "deal" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (consisting of tax) for the one sink drain. I looked up notes from last time I had the specific sink cleaned from another company and it only cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper just cost $118 + tax) and that was just 9 months ago. I feel that costs were increased because I had a "Deal". An Angie's list article from March stated depending upon the marketplace and severity of clog, the average cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Shame on me for not bringing my past invoice to be sure I wasn't getting rate gouged.</p>

<p>Discover if there are any lead pipes in the home. Homes that were constructed prior to 1986 typically have lead or galvanized plumbing. Lead, as you understand, no matter how beneficial, is an ecological toxic substance (note the need for unleaded gasoline and paint in homes that is not lead based). You might not want to live in a home that has lead pipes if you have children.</p>
<p>Pro Idea: If you're going to be draining a dishwasher through the system, now is the best time to eliminate the knockout plug inside the dishwasher inlet. Use a hammer to tap a screwdriver into the inlet until the plug is broken off; obtain the little piece of plastic from inside the disposer. This is also the perfect time to make the connections for a hardwired unit with a pre-existing junction box.</p>
