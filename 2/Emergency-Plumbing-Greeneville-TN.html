It is recommended that you permit your unit to go empty of one kind of salt before including another to avoid the incident of any problems.

<p>Most importantly, never plant anything up against your house, in front of windows, nor near to your lateral. (Your lateral is the major line from your house to the city line.) You might have a concept of where your lateral is located if you have actually had plumbing service prior to planting. If you do not understand, spend the minimal cost to have a professional plumber locate the lateral for you so that you do not make the mistake of planting over, to close, or perhaps go into and break the line. If you are employing somebody to plant for you, make certain to mark the area of the line with non-toxic gardening chalk or garden safe paint so that she or he will also know the areas to avoid. Your line will be simple to recognize if you have a clean-out.</p>
