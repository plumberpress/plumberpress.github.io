<p>A cross-connection is any momentary or long-term connection between a public water system or customer's drinkable (i.e., drinking) water system and any source or system consisting of nonpotable water or other compounds. An example is the piping between a public water supply or customer's safe and clean water supply and an auxiliary water supply, cooling system or watering system.</p>
<p>Mineral deposits get captured on the sides of a pipe and harden. In time, the deposits collect, up until they form a traffic jam that makes it harder for water and waste to pass through your pipes. These deposits occur more regularly when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, because the toilet doesn't have the power to blast the minerals away from the drain pipe. You might have your drain pipes expertly cleaned up if you want to make doubly sure your toilet is the issue before you replace it. It's time for a new one if your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still clogs.</p>
