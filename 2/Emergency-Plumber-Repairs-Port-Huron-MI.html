<h3>Cleaning Drains in Port Huron Michigan</h2>
<p>Plumbers charge $75 to $150 to install a gas line sediment trap. Sediment traps capture wetness and sediment so that they don't get in the control unit. Unlike a drip leg, the flow of the gas is altered to eliminate any sediment. A sediment trap may be consisted of in a drip leg install.

<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, however he charged $300 plus tax. Rather of repairing the leak, he wanted to replace the whole piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he couldn't simply fix the fittings instead of a total replace. He said he would change the washers and that might do it. He then disconnected the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he left with no additional repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there because it wasn't on a load. As quickly as he left, my tenants tried the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he stated he would not return since he had another consultation. A perfect bad plumber story.</p>
