<p>It is necessary that you deal with any and all problems that you find in the house's plumbing system (or in other places in the house, for that matter) with the seller or real estate agent prior to making a deal or closing the sale. While numerous homes come with a home warranty that will cover the numerous systems within the home for a particular period of time, you can still be out of pocket if the plumbing system remains in disrepair and your home ends up being damaged as a result. In most circumstances, you will discover that repairs that need to be made will be made in order to get the house off the market. If you are a bit helpful and have the time to do repair work yourself, you can also use the results from your house plumbing inspection to negotiate a lower rate on the house to accommodate for the materials and labor involved in remedying any problem points.</p>
