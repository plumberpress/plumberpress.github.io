<p>Regrettably, when water is completely stripped of calcium and magnesium to end up being soft, it often becomes destructive. Destructive water causes leaching of copper pipes and faucet components, particularly in areas where water sits for extended periods of time. Although this is not a health concern, it is the main reason for the blue and green stains being left in your bathroom and utility room sinks.</p>
<p>Take an example: Say the your heater is 8 years old and you need to hire a plumber for that burner package. The total repair costs might remain in the $300 variety. A gas hot water heater (not counting miscellaneous plumbing parts) costs $400 to $1200 (electric hot water heater cost about $400 to $800). That repair expense is nearly half the cost of the heater itself, and it's an old heater on its last legs anyway. Go for the brand-new heater.</p>
