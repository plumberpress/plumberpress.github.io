<p>Do yourself a favor and purchase a versatile water supply line. They're a lot much easier to install than stiff metal or plastic tubing. Make sure to get one that's covered with stainless-steel mesh. For an excellent seal, hold the hose so it intends directly into the shutoff or fill valve while you're screwing on the ports.
