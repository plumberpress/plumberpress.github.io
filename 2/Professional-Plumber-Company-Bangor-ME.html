When utilized in the context of a fire sprinkler system, a backflow preventer device is used to ensure that water does not stream from the lawn sprinkler back into the municipal water supply, or other source of drinking water. Regrettably, water kept in the sprinkler system can become contaminated. There is potential for the infected water to become a health threat if permitted to return to the water supply. The backflow preventer is meant to prevent water receding towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be inspected routinely for effectiveness, as well as inspected annually by a fire inspection company in order to ensure they are working as they should.</p>
