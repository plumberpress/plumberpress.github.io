Handling fixing a burst pipe is definitely not worth the cost savings sustained from using a chemical drain cleaner.</p>
<p>Pull the two lines out of the trimmer, one at a time. Dispose of the harmed fuel lines. A small cylindrical fuel line filter will pop off the thin line leading into the tank when you pull the fuel lines from the trimmer.
