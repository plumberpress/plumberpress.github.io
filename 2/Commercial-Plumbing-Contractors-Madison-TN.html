Some elements might have really tight tolerances that need to be maintained. A crucial thing to identify on each element is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the motion or directs of the element. The guide is a really important part of the design of each part. If the component is not repaired properly, the guide could restrict the motion (rather than direct or stable) of the part, which might cause the part to not work to its abilities.

In many cases the guides are limiting the travel of the component causing lower test outcomes than what is required.</p>
