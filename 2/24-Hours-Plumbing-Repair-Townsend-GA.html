<p>To link a power cable to the new system, eliminate the electrical cover plate on the bottom of the disposer and sign up with the colored wires found inside with their equivalents in the cable, utilizing wire nuts. The green ground wire is looped under the green screw on the system. This can be done at any point prior to installation. Plumbing plans are not needed for one- and two-family homes or townhouses, as defined in the California Residential Code, and their accessory structures.</p>

A worn water valve can lock up and spring a leak. If the rotor valve's seal is leaking, it is most likely cracked and just requires to be replaced.</p>
