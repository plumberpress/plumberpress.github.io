<p>Soft water is safe to drink. Throughout the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do release salt into the water when getting ahold of the solidity minerals. However the amount of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and really is far less than what is extensively imagined. If you have moderately hard water, for example five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only adding 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested everyday salt consumption. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the amount of sodium added by water softeners is minimal.</p>
