<p>It is essential to understand that RPZ assemblies, while more reliable, experience much higher pressure and volume loss than double-check assemblies. Fluctuations in line pressure, downstream or upstream, will prompt an effectively operating RPZ assembly to regularly release small amounts of water. During a backflow condition, a big volume of water will stream from the relief valve. For this reason, RPZ assemblies shouldn't be set up in areas based on water damage. Appropriate drainage must also be supplied.</p>
