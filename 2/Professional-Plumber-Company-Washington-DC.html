<p>Fountains and garden ponds: Automatic refills on these water features must have either a PVB, an AVB or RP backflow preventers. If backflows take place from them, these water features are thought about a health threat. Refill lines and the backflow preventer type and area need to be shown on construction plans. Any backflow preventer set up on a fountain or garden pond should be tested upon installation and then each year.</p>
<p>The EcoWater ESS1152 Series are non-resin based systems that can be tailored to your water needs. Your EcoWater Pro will evaluate your water to figure out the ideal water treatment for your home. A single tank or cabinet-style system needs less space because the softener's salt water tank nests within the salt tank. The CareSoft ® system was established with the exact same advanced engineering as the Pro and Elite models, with resin that delivers high-performance firmness removal you can rely on for years to come.</p>
