<p>For an outdoor gas light or home appliance whose gas supply line is buried, water leaking into the gas line can trigger an obstruction or can cause deterioration that obstructs the line.

This sediment ultimately gets tough and removes from the capacity of your water heater. This solidified sediment is most likely the source of the noise.</p>
<p>It is always aggravating when you flip that switch and the waste disposal unit doesn't switch on. This can result in clogged sinks and a big mess.
