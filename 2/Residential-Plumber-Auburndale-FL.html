<p>When the water does not end up being soft enough, one should initially consider problems with the salt that is utilized, or mechanical breakdowns of softener parts. When these components are not the cause of the unacceptable water softening, it might be time to replace the softener resin, or possibly even the entire softener. Cation exchange water softeners eliminate the calcium and magnesium ions found in tough water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. Once all the ions are completely exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regrowth procedure to flush the system of excess ions and charge with new sodium ions.</p>
<p>Hydro jetting is a process in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at approximately 3,500 PSI. This enables the sewer lines to be cleaned quickly and effectively with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, giving off from the reverse and forward jets in the nozzle, propel the hose through the line to get rid of particles such as difficult water scale, silt, grease, and sand deposits.</p>
