<h3>Choosing The Right Plumbing Service Cambridge MA</h3>
<p>Once the test results reveal the repair is complete, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was separated during the repair procedure. It is important that the plumbing system be switched on extremely gradually to guarantee no damage is done to the piping system. When the system is pressurized, air should be eliminated from the plumbing system. Each outlet on the plumbing system must be checked to make sure no valves were unintentionally left open or did not close correctly when re-pressurized. As soon as the plumbing system is pressurized, make certain all valves are totally open and notify the water user that the plumbing system has been gone back to service.</p>
