This truly depends upon what condition the remainder of the pipes are in, and how difficult the old system is to get rid of. Oftentimes, elimination will only add an extra $25 to $50 to the total costs, however in some cases the costs could be greater if extra pipes need to also be changed.</p>
<p>The majority of backflow preventers are designed to enable the components to be removed for repair while the main body stays set up in the piping system.
