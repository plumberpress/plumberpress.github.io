<p>We've currently seen what these 2 terms share, so what's the distinction between them? When it pertains to the issue of hard water, a conventional water softener actually eliminates calcium, silica and magnesium ions, leaving it with little amounts of what is called momentary solidity". The softener replaces these ions with salt through a process called ion exchange.</p>

<h3>Necessary Plumbing Services From Plumbing Contractors Edmonton KY</h3>
<p>A. Usually wax doesn't "go bad" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to prevent smells. If you are experiencing a leak coming from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or full blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Also, make certain the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" undetected issue. If you aren't sure where the leak is coming from, try putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours.</p>
<p>Gas available to businesses and homes is naturally safe; however, leaking gas is not something that should be left ignored. Leaking gas is not constantly simple to detect, but gas does have a smell that has been added as a component to make the gas simple to smell. Call a plumber right away as you might have a natural gas leak if you smell something like rotten eggs.</p>
