<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumbers Lake Station IN</h3>
<p>A lot of houses or structures that were built in the 1970s typically have galvanized piping. Gradually, the plumbing system can wear and the pipes can begin to wear away. This can trigger low water pressure and impact the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping includes iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to supply weather security. As the external finish of zinc starts to erode, the pipe is exposed to water and moisture, triggering the iron to ultimately rust.</p>
<p>Soft water is safe to consume. Throughout the ion exchange process, the resin beads do release salt into the water when grabbing ahold of the hardness minerals. However the amount of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and really is far less than what is extensively imagined. If you have reasonably tough water, for instance five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only adding 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended day-to-day salt consumption. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the amount of salt included by water softeners is negligible.</p>
