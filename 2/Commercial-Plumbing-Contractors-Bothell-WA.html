<p>The problem of leakage can be attributed to any number of aspects which can vary from the tank is old and worn, to over-pressurization, as well as bad maintenance. The hot water heater tank need to have some room to account for the expansion that takes place when heating the water. The thermal expansion requires to leave, thus the need for a growth tank to help regulate the pressure. If the tank is old and worn out, the force put in by the expansion taking place when boiling the water triggers the tank to crack and begin leaking.
