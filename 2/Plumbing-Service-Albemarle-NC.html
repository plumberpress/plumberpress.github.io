<p>Leaks are sneaky. Over time, the resin beads in the water softener will become covered with calcium and magnesium ions, decreasing their capability to soften tough water.

WaterBoss water softener systems feature an entire house water filtration with its patented self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the dissolved rock and dirt and sediment are sent down the drain. With the resin beads charged," the water softener goes back to service, providing the entire home with clean, soft water.</p>
