This permits the sewer lines to be cleaned rapidly and effectively with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, producing from the reverse and forward jets in the nozzle, move the hose through the line to get rid of debris such as difficult water scale, silt, grease, and sand deposits.</p>
<p>Leaky faucets are bothersome, and replacing them is an undesirable expense. Save cash by repairing the faucet yourself. Is your hot water heater making noises or leaking water?

Water softener systems utilize resin beads that attract and attach salt ions in the softener tank. Pumps push difficult water through the resin beads exchanging hardness ions with sodium ions, softening the water.</p>
