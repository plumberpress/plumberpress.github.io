<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to manage peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to effectively adapt to your service' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high circulation demand, tanks come on-line to include flow rate capability. During durations of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This brand-new approach to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation technology, and it's arguably the most important development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
