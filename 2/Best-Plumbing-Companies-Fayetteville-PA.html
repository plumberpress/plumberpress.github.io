<p>Finally, the most complex and sophisticated backflow preventer is the decreased pressure zone device. This device includes no less than 5 separately running valves (two check valves and a differential relief valve sealed at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve serves as a back up system to the other 4. During basic water streams at style pressure, the two check valves remain open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by particles or if siphonage occurs to the connected service pipeline. To avoid backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a sophisticated and reliable  (if costly) device is best used in crucial areas where cross contamination could be a direct threat to life and health.</p>
