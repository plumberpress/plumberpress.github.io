Trees and shrubs are a common cause of sewer clogs to the house. Roots can grow into the smallest fracture or space in your house's drain pipe, where they thrive in the nutrient rich environment provided by the sewer.</p>
<p>Next, recognize that unless your water is exceptionally difficult, all the incoming water does not need to be softened.

Decreased pressure in the pipe might allow contaminated water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be drawn up into the system.</p>
