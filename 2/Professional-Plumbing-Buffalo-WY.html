WaterBoss water softener systems include an entire home water filtration with its trademarked self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the dissolved rock and dirt and sediment are sent down the drain.

<p>Warning: If utilized on a water supply where a pump and pressure tank supplies the water (like is utilized on most rural houses that have a well), the PVB may spit water each time the pump shuts down. This is because the pressure variations caused by the pump and pressure tank system can trigger backflow from the watering system back into the water supply. The probability of water spitting, and the amount of water that spits out, both increase with a longer mainline on the watering system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One way to stop, or at least minimize, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB might still spill a little water with the check valve installed, nevertheless in most cases it ought to be much less water.</p>
<p>If there is a leak, we will find the leak and shut the gas line down at the main line if it has not already been completed. Then, our professional will dig to find the gas line and leak. The gas line will be replaced and pressure checked to ensure there are no leakages. If the leak is adequately repaired, the website will be cleaned up and brought back to its previous elegance.</p>
