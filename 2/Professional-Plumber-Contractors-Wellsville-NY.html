<p>Water softeners add worth to your operation by safeguarding your water-using equipment from bad performance and premature failure. Some hard water problems are extremely visible, like sprayers and dispensers ending up being clogged.

Clogged fixtures trigger replacement or reconditioning costs and can frustrate your consumers.
