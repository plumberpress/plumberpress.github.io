Ion exchange increases the quantity of salt in water, in order to decrease its mineral material. Generally, this procedure adds 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending upon how tough the water was to start with. Harder water will result in more salt, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this boost in sodium is minor, however if you've been encouraged by a physician to follow a strict low salt diet plan this increase can position problems.</p>

It normally uses up your kitchen sink drain but can be set up on simply one side if you have a battle drain setup.</p>
