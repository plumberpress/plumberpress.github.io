<p>Last but not least, the most complicated and sophisticated backflow preventer is the minimized pressure zone device. This device consists of no less than five individually operating valves (2 check valves and a differential relief valve sealed off at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve functions as a back up system to the other 4. During standard water flows at style pressure, the two check valves stay open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by debris or if siphonage occurs to the connected service pipeline.

This triggers the disc to open, permitting air to bring back and get in the valve pressure equivalent to ambient atmospheric standard. This remediation of pressure breaks the siphon and avoids cross contamination.</p>
