<p>Hard water use might affect the performance of household home appliances. When warmed, calcium carbonate and magnesium carbonate settle out of suspension (precipitate) from the water and form a mineral deposit at the bottom of the hot water heater.

<p>The Required Inspections Table shown below lists those inspections that must be performed to validate that your work abides by the Virginia Uniform Statewide Building Code. Please note that Virginia's Building Code restricts using any plumbing components or devices prior to approval of all required inspections. We hope this list is helpful to you throughout the course of your project. Please call our Structure Inspections Department, at 804-501-4360, if you have any concerns about what is required for each inspection or if you need aid scheduling an inspection. Structure, Electrical, Mechanical or Fire Defense work need extra licenses and inspections. Different notices are available to explain the inspections required for each kind of authorization.</p>
<p>Responsive flow innovation works by constantly bringing tanks off-line and on-line in reaction to the water demands of your carwash. For instance, in a four-tank MTS setup with responsive flow technology, only one of the 4 tanks is needed to soften water when the carwash isn't busy. Nevertheless, more tanks come online as the wash bays fill up. This responsive design allows the MTS to use up to 50% less salt and 38% less regrowth water than traditional single-tank or twin rotating systems.</p>
<p>A water softener is composed of a mineral tank and a backflush tank. It gathers hardness minerals within its conditioning tank and from time to time flushes them away to drain. Ion exchangers are frequently utilized for water softening. When an ion exchanger is applied for water softening, it will replace the calcium and magnesium ions in the water with other ions such as salt or potassium. The result of our advanced water softener technology is healthier, smoother water for you and your household, while still maintaining an efficient flow rate.</p>
