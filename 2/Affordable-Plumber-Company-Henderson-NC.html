We will provide you with options for repair or replacement and recommend the best service depending on your specific requirements. For double-bowl sinks, the very best way to set about things is to use a continuous waste disposer kit including a discharge tube, baffle tee, and tailpiece. Such kits direct both drains to a single trap. Depending on the place of the stub out, you'll need either an end outlet or center outlet set.</p>
