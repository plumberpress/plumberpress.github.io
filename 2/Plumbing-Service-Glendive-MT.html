Repairs are the correct fix for problems such as missing out on or harmed washers, aerators, nuts, bolts, and other little parts of the entire component. If these replacements and repairs do not work or if the repairs cost over 30% of the cost of changing your faucet, then we suggest a new faucet installation.</p>
