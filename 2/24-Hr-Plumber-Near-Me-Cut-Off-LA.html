When your water lines are repiped, it just means old copper and galvanized pipes are changed with new pipes. We discover that houses 15 years or older who have never ever had repiping work are the most likely candidates for water line replacement. If you have an older home and are experiencing frequent and significant leaks, you could be in need of water line repiping. If you do have frequent leakages, we find that repiping can in fact be the more affordable and much better long-lasting service.</p>

The consecutive 90 Â° turns in such a setup can cause incorrect drainage. Depending upon the length of the waste arm, you may have the ability to cut off its elbow and utilize the remainder as a straight discharge tube.</p>
