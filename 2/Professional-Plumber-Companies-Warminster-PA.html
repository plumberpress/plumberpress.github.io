<p>The City of Bellingham requires a backflow preventer on any cross-connection or prospective cross-connection. The backflow preventer may be required on the water service line, within the building, or in both locations. The backflow preventer you choose need to be listed on the Washington State Department of Health's Approved Backflow Prevention Assembly List. Assemblies not presently listed must have been listed at the time of the original installation.</p>
