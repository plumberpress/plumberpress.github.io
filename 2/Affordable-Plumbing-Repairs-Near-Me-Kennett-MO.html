<p>Please let EBMUD understand of any situation that might require a backflow device. Often conditions on residential or commercial properties change that might need a backflow device, such as treating a boiler with additives or setting up a well with a pump. Sewer repairs are more than an inconvenience for your organisation, they can cause financial losses and in some instances can stop your business completely. For restaurants having a drain back up or a sewer line break can be devastating. Even in a small workplace the problems caused by even little drain problems can trigger major concerns.</p>
<p>To get rid of the smells, first attempt pouring BioSmart (readily available at WJ McNabb Plumbing) down your drain. You can also attempt 1 cup lemon juice down the drain. After a couple of minutes, run warm thin down the drain. Insufficient or inaccessible cleanouts: No matter how effective a drainage system is, it will likely get clogged at some time. Plumbers and house owners must be able to clean out their drainage pipes when this happens. Structures without sufficient cleanout valves, or cleanout valves that can't be easily reached, are at risk of a pipe rupturing.</p>
