<h3>Commercial Plumbing Services, Available 24/7 Meriden CT</h3>
<p>Think of all the locations water flows in and out of your home. These are the areas that a professional evaluation must cover. That includes your piping, sinks, faucets, toilets, and other home appliances. Even your water lines should be covered. While your hot water heater and toilets will receive unique attention, a knowledgeable plumber wants to analyze the complete health of your system. That indicates testing for correct water pressure. After all, too much pressure can harm your plumbing, and too little can leave your house with dysfunctional water home appliances.</p>
<p>On average, the cost to replace a toilet varies in between $ 122 and $228, with the majority of homeowners spending around $ 150 to $180. This does not consist of the price of the toilet, which averages $ 99 to $199, for an overall toilet replacement cost of $ 221 to $427. A high-efficiency toilet with extra features can cost $ 800 to $1,500 to install. The typical installation takes a plumber 2 to 4 hours at $ 65 per hour. If you're replacing an existing toilet, include $ 30 to $50 to eliminate your old toilet.</p>
