<p>Backflow is the unwanted reversal of flow in a drinkable water distribution system. Water that is constantly under pressure can only stream in one direction. Then how can water flow in reverse? Water will always stream toward the point of most affordable pressure. If a water main were to break or if the fire department opened several fire hydrants to help combat a fire, the pressure in the water pipe might drop. The demand upstream could trigger a reversal in circulation.</p>

<p>In water supply systems, water is typically maintained at a substantial pressure to allow water to flow from the tap, shower, or other fixture. Water pressure may be or fail minimized when a water main bursts, pipes freeze, or there is an all of a sudden high need on the water system (for example, when a number of fire hydrants are opened). Decreased pressure in the pipe may permit infected water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be drawn up into the system.</p>
