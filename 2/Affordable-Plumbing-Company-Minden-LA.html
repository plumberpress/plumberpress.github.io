When used in the context of a fire lawn sprinkler, a backflow preventer device is used to ensure that water does not flow from the lawn sprinkler back into the municipal supply of water, or other source of drinking water. Sadly, water held in the lawn sprinkler can end up being contaminated. If permitted to re-enter the water system, there is potential for the polluted water to become a health hazard.
