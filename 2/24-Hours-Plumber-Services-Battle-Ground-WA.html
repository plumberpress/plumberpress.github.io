If these repairs and replacements do not work or if the repairs cost over 30% of the cost of replacing your faucet, then we recommend a new faucet installation.</p>

Keep in mind that since of the way a lever works, the locknuts for the majority of toilet trip levers will be reverse threaded so make certain you're turning things the right method.
