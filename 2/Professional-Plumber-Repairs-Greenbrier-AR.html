Lowered Pressure Backflow Prevention Assembly (RP): An RP is a mechanical backflow preventer that consists of two separately acting, spring-loaded check valves with a hydraulically operating, mechanically independent, spring-loaded pressure differential relief valve in between the check valves and below the very first check valve.</p>
<p>Caution: If utilized on a water supply where a pump and pressure tank provides the water (like is used on most rural houses that have a well), the PVB might spit water each time the pump turns off. Because the pressure variations triggered by the pump and pressure tank system can trigger backflow from the watering system back into the water system, this is.

So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline in between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One method to stop, or at least lower, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB may still spill a little water with the check valve set up, nevertheless in many cases it need to be much less water.</p>
