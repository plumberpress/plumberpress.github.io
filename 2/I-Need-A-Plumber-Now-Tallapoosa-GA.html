<p>A toilet auger works the opposite method that a plunger does. Rather than dislodging the blockage with unfavorable pressure, it actually presses into the blockage, working even more into where the obstruction is occurring. The auger or snake" is then utilized to push the clog out of the drain pipe, leaving a clear course for water to flow easily. The auger's corkscrew-shaped suggestion helps require it further down into the clog, making it simpler to clear.</p>
<p>Water fountains and garden ponds: Automatic refills on these water features should have either a PVB, an AVB or RP backflow preventers. These water features are thought about a health danger if backflows occur from them. Refill lines and the backflow preventer type and location should be suggested on building plans. Any backflow preventer installed on a fountain or garden pond must be evaluated upon installation and after that every year.</p>
