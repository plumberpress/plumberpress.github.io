Black iron pipe is, simply put, the same thing, but without the zinc finish. The zinc coating on galvanized pipe for gas is implied to keep the pipe from corroding from contact with wetness. While it does its job quite well, over time, it still does corrode. This permits the toilet to flush. A plumber will charge $135 to fix it.</p>
<p>Installed under the sink, the garbage disposal is meant for chopping up smidgens of waste food.

<p>Almost all softeners fall into one of two classifications. Timed designs have programmable timeclocks that will restore on an established schedule and then return to service. These work well for households that are on routine water-using cycles but will squander more water and salt since they restore whether the resin needs it or not. Demand-control models, with either mechanical and electrical sensing units, normally regrow after many gallons of water have actually been softened. If you have a rising and falling water use schedule, such designs are convenient.</p>
