So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline in between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less most likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe.

The PVB may still spill a little water with the check valve installed, however in most cases it must be much less water.</p>
