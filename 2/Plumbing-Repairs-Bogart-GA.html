<p>Hydro-jetting is a technique of getting rid of build up and debris in tanks and lines by utilizing exceptionally high-pressure water to get rid of clogs.

<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Instead of a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to deal with peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively adapt to your business' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high flow demand, tanks come on-line to include circulation rate capability. During periods of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This new approach to softening is called responsive or progressive flow technology, and it's probably the most important development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
