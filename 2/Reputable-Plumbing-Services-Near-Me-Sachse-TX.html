Backpressure can be triggered by pumps or temperature boosts in boilers, or if there is a decrease in the water system pressure. Backsiphonage happens when negative or decreased pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, normally due to a disruption or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or nearby firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A common kind of backflow preventer is the lowered pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
