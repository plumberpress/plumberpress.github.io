Eliminate itchy rashes and experience smoother, softer skin and hair with a point-of-use shower head water softener. These models connect to or replace your existing shower head to balance the pH of your water, stop scale from forming, and filter out minerals. Most people dump food waste in the garbage, which indicates more garbage to enter garbage dumps or be incinerated.

Blanton Plumbing are experienced and licensed, and we can ensure your disposal will be set up properly and work exactly as it should.

The cost to install a disposal will depend on the type of disposal system you purchase, whether you need to replace an old disposal or install a totally new system, and any additional electric or plumbing work required. The kind of waste disposal unit you purchase will have the biggest impact on your installation costs.</p>
<p>Scrape off the old putty with a plastic putty knife so you don't scratch the sink. Seal the new basket in the sink with plumber's putty as shown in Picture 4. Plumber's putty can not be utilized on certain new sinks, but these will be labeled to that impact. Utilize a non-water-based silicone if you can't utilize plumber's putty. Excess putty will eject in between the new basket strainer and the sink when you tighten the locknut in place. Clean it off with a rag or paper towel. Ensure to insert the cardboard friction ring between the rubber gasket and the locknut so the locknut spins easily, without capturing on the gasket.</p>

<p>We're changing a gas water heater in our demonstration. The steps for changing a propane water heater are precisely the exact same, and those for an electric hot water heater are comparable. Recurring leaks and repairs. If your hot water heater is over ten years old, it has likely lost much of its effectiveness; continuing to repair it, with its regular breakdowns, is not economical in the long run. As a result, we advise changing your unit if it is over ten years old.</p>
<p>Check the disposal. Turn the power back on, run water into the sink and switch on the disposal to ensure it works. Inspect underneath to be sure there aren't any leaks. Run some food through the disposal to be sure it grinds and gets disposed of correctly. Pipes made of galvanized steel are no longer used in brand-new houses, however lots of houses built in between the 1930s - 1980s still have them. When discovered and replaced with another pipe product, galvanized steel pipes need to be removed by a professional plumber.</p>
