<p>You can also depend upon water softeners to minimize your everyday operating costs by conserving cleaning agent and permitting you to use lower water temperatures while keeping a premium wash. Water hardness, measured by the grains per gallon (gpg) of magnesium and calcium in the water, varies throughout the U.S. from a little hard (<3 gpg) to very hard (>14 gpg).</p>
<p>Warning: If used on a water system where a pump and pressure tank supplies the water (like is used on the majority of rural homes that have a well), the PVB may spit water each time the pump shuts off. Because the pressure variations caused by the pump and pressure tank system can cause backflow from the watering system back into the water system, this is. The possibility of water spitting, and the quantity of water that spits out, both increase with a longer mainline on the irrigation system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less most likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One way to stop, or at least decrease, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB might still spill a little water with the check valve installed, however in most cases it must be much less water.</p>
