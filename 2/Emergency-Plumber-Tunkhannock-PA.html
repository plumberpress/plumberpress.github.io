<p>Our plumbers are licensed, bonded, and guaranteed and satisfy our rigid trust accreditation standards. A great general rule is to replace faucets that show rust, rust, fractures, and otherwise deep damages. Damaged and corroded parts make repairs challenging and expensive, implying a faucet installation is more worthwhile.

If these repairs and replacements do not work or if the repairs cost over 30% of the cost of changing your faucet, then we recommend a brand-new faucet installation.</p>
<p>Next, examine the body. Depending upon the size and maker, the bodies can be made of bronze, plastic, stainless steel, cast iron or ductile iron.

It is necessary that the repair specialist is sensitive to the solidity and kind of the different coverings used on iron body units so as not to harm the protective coating.</p>
