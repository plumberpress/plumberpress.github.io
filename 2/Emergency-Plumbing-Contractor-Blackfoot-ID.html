<p>Button Plumbing was fantastic. If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and included 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly leaked in the previous. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into.

I was super pleased with their service.</p>
