<p>These are all signs that your system must be examined by a plumber. We do not suggest trying to repair this specific appliance on your own, because it does present a security risk, due to the sharp blades that are utilized to grind and slice waste. You need to also prevent using any kind of chemical drain cleaners on your waste disposal unit because these chemicals will only harm the home appliance even more.</p>
