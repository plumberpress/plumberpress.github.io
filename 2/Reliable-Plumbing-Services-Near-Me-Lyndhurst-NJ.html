<p>The problem of leak can be credited to any number of factors which can range from the tank is old and broken, to over-pressurization, as well as poor maintenance. The water heater tank must have some room to account for the growth that takes place when heating the water. The thermal growth needs to escape, thus the need for an expansion tank to help manage the pressure. The force exerted by the expansion taking location when boiling the water triggers the tank to break and start leaking if the tank is old and used out. The treatment for this is to replace the hot water heater system.</p>
