<p>Most plumbers will get rid of the old system to install the brand-new one at the same hourly rate.

<p>Have used Plumb Crazy on 3 different celebrations, the last including a water line repair for a leak under the cement slab in our house. Billy and Hector were our technicians and they were great. They quickly found the leak and repaired it without making a huge mess. They, just like each person we've encountered with Plumb Crazy, were courteous, prompt, and really knowledgeable.

<p>In the average repair, the old rubber parts should be eliminated and replaced with new rubber parts. When putting the backflow prevention assembly back together whether they are hardware or rubber parts, it is essential that just original factory repair parts are utilized. The rubber parts the producer produces for the assembly are the only ones the assembly was designed to use and altering the rubber from the initial factory parts will affect the operation of the backflow prevention assembly and void any approvals.</p>
