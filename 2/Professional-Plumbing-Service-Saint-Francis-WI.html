<p>Replacing your flapper might require a little different steps than we reveal (Images 2 and 3). Your flapper might screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. Discovering a replacement flapper might be the hardest part of the job if you have an unusual flush valve. To discover an ideal replacement, switch off the water, take the old one with you to the house center or hardware store. (Turn off the water before eliminating the flapper.) You might not find an identical match, however possibilities are you'll find one of the same shape and size. If not, try a plumbing supply shop (in the Telephone Directory under Plumbing Supplies") or search online.</p>
