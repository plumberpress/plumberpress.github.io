<p>Backflow preventers are likewise required by the plumbing code. Other than within Coastline, the plumbing authority for Seattle Public Utilities clients is King County plumbing (Public Health - Seattle & King County). The City of Shoreline is the plumbing authority within Coastline's city limitations. When it comes to backflow preventer requirements, Seattle Public Utilities works with both King County plumbing and the City of Coastline.</p>
<p>Some jurisdictions also enable options to backflow preventers. For example, Philadelphia's water district requires all residential systems supplying devoted sprinkler heads to have a connection from the lawn sprinkler to the toilet tank that's farthest from the supply of water. This gets rid of the need for a backflow preventer, due to the fact that each time that toilet is flushed, it draws water through the fire line to keep the water fresh.</p>
<p>Discharge piping linked to a storm sewer will be equipped with backwater check valve. In commercial applications, for instance, AWWA M-14: Backflow Prevention and Cross-Connection Control Recommended Practices recommends a DCV assembly on dry or damp sprinkler systems unless there is a danger of a high-hazard cross-connection. In those cases, an RPZ assembly is suggested.</p>

<p>Changing your flapper may require a little various steps than we reveal (Pictures 2 and 3). Your flapper might screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. If you have an unusual flush valve, finding a replacement flapper might be the hardest part of the task.

If not, try a plumbing supply store (in the Yellow Pages under Plumbing Materials") or search online.</p>
