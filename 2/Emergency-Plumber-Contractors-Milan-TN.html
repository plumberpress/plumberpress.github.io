<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Instead of a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to handle peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to efficiently adapt to your business' circulation rates throughout the day. During durations of high flow need, tanks come online to include flow rate capability. During periods of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This new approach to softening is called progressive or responsive flow technology, and it's perhaps the most essential innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
