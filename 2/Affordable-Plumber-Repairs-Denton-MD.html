<p>As water goes through the supply pipes and after that out the faucets, showerheads, icemaker, washing machine, water dishwasher, boiler, and heater, it's leaving behind hard, crusty mineral deposits.

In severe cases, hard-water deposits can drastically limit the water circulation, which puts undue pressure on the whole plumbing system.</p>

<p>If you're living with decreased pressure from scale-ridden pipes, dry hair, stiff laundry, and limitless appliance repair bills, you need a water softener.

Hard water ravages hot water heater, and without a softener, your energy expenses will continue to barrel skyward. If your supply of water is hard, the continuous cycle of replacements and repairs will continue until your home is protected by a water softener.</p>
<p>Button Plumbing was terrific. If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and added two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly dripped in the previous. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were extremely friendly and got the work done rapidly. The cost was rather affordable. I will certainly utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was extremely happy with their service.</p>
