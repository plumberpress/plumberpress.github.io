When used in the context of a fire lawn sprinkler, a backflow preventer device is used to guarantee that water does not stream from the lawn sprinkler back into the community water system, or other source of drinking water. Sadly, water kept in the lawn sprinkler can end up being contaminated. If allowed to return to the water supply, there is potential for the infected water to end up being a health hazard. The backflow preventer is intended to prevent water flowing back towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be checked routinely for efficiency, as well as checked every year by a fire inspection company in order to guarantee they are working as they should.</p>
