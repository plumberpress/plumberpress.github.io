There are hydraulic conditions such as pressure fluctuations and disc compression that could lead to false data on the workings of the backflow prevention assembly. Hydraulic conditions such as water hammer can lead to severe pressure spikes that might damage parts. The results of elevated temperature can also cause excessive pressure conditions which might harm the parts in the parts.
