<p>Remove the old putty with a plastic putty knife so you don't scratch the sink. Seal the new basket in the sink with plumber's putty as shown in Picture 4. Plumber's putty can not be used on specific new sinks, but these will be identified to that effect. If you can't use plumber's putty, utilize a non-water-based silicone. When you tighten the locknut in place, excess putty will squeeze out in between the new basket strainer and the sink. Clean it off with a rag or paper towel.
