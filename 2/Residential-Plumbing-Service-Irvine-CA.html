The most common tools required are a cordless drill, hacksaw, hammer drill, and locking pliers.</p>
<p>Responsive flow innovation works by continuously bringing tanks online and off-line in response to the water needs of your carwash. For instance, in a four-tank MTS setup with responsive circulation technology, only one of the 4 tanks is needed to soften water when the carwash isn't busy. Nevertheless, more tanks come online as the wash bays fill. This responsive design enables the MTS to consume to 50% less salt and 38% less regeneration water than standard single-tank or twin alternating systems.</p>
