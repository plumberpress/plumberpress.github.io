<p>Soft water is safe to drink. During the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do launch sodium into the water when grabbing ahold of the solidity minerals. However the amount of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and in fact is far less than what is widely envisioned. If you have reasonably difficult water, for example five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only including 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested day-to-day salt consumption. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the amount of salt added by water softeners is minimal.</p>
