If there is a leak in a part of the sewer line running beneath your house's foundation, the very best you can hope for is to find out rapidly. Otherwise, as the leaky sewer line spills out beneath your house, a sinkhole will cause the structure to shift and develop cracks. In this case, you'll need skilled plumbers in addition to foundation repair professionals.</p>
