If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and added two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly dripped in the past.

<h3>Plumbing & HVAC Service Oak Grove MO</h3>
<p>Strange Sounds - If unusual gurgling is coming from your drain, it most likely needs an extensive cleaning. When food or waste clog your drains, it makes it hard for the water to go through. Since of the tight area, the pipes typically make strange gurgling noises as water attempts to go through a clogged pipe. This causes the water to bubble, as only little pockets of air are accessible, resulting in the strange sounds originating from your sink.</p>
<p>The connections of kitchen sink faucets are another common leak-prone area. These can likewise be tough to repair as they are usually situated behind the sink, in cramped areas. The best method to tighten them is with a set of locking pliers. Wrenches take up too much space and need a wide swing angle, which may be challenging to get in small areas.</p>
