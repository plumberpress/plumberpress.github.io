<p>The LAGBC is based upon the 2013 California Green Structure Standards Code, commonly called "CALGreen" that was established and mandated by the State to achieve consistency amongst the various jurisdictions within the State; minimize the building's energy and water use; reduce waste; and lower the carbon footprint. Constant feed disposals are simple to run: you run water in the kitchen sink, turn a switch, and feed the disposal with food scraps and compostable waste. With this kind of garbage disposal, however, bottle caps, flatware, and other metal particles can in some cases get captured in the blades. This can harm the blades and need repairs.</p>
