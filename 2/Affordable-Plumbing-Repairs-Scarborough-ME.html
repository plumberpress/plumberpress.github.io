Backflow prevention gadgets run by permitting water to flow in only one direction. In a vulnerable water service connection, potable water can flow both in and out of a building or fixture. When water service is interrupted in the street or in a structure for any reason, there is a pressure drop which can draw contaminated water in reverse into the water supply. For example, cleaning fluids might be drawn back from car washes; stagnant water from fire sprinkler systems might get in the drinking waterline; germs and pathogens of all sorts can be siphoned back into the water system from cooling cooling towers; and chemicals from medical center's X-ray development may flow backwards into the drinkable water supply. To secure water quality, backflow defense is needed where the end user presents a threat of polluting the city's water supply.</p>
