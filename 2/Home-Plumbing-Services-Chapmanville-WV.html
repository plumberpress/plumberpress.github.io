<p>Running a gas line to a grill or fire pit costs $20 per foot, or $200 to $700 usually depending on the length from the main gas line.

If you have inside-the-wall supply pipes that need replacement, your plumber might be able to restrict the wall demolition he requires to do by using an alternative piping item: Cross-linked polyethylene tubing, also referred to as PEX, is a flexible plastic hose.</p>
<p>Do yourself a favor and buy a flexible water system line. They're a lot easier to install than stiff metal or plastic tubing. Be sure to get one that's covered with stainless steel mesh. For a good seal, hold the hose so it aims directly into the shutoff or fill valve while you're screwing on the connectors. Make them handtight, then include another quarter turn with pliers. Connections that are too tight can actually trigger leaks or spin the fill valve inside the tank. If required, check for leakages and tighten them a bit more.</p>
