<h3>Golden Rules To Follow In Plumbing Emergencies Stroudsburg PA</h3>
<p>For instance, backflow can occur when there's a break in the main water line or when a fire hydrant is opened for use. Water is no longer being pushed forward into your home and will flow backwards into the city water lines because pressure is lost during these events.

<p>Water softening refers to the removal of magnesium, calcium, and other minerals from water. The most popular method of water softening is through a process called ion exchange.
