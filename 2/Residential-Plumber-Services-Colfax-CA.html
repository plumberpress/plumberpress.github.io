<p>For shallow pipes without any neighboring energies or obstructions, digging through and changing the pipe by hand would likely be more affordable than relining it internally. However, if your damaged pipe runs under your driveway, any big trees or pathways, dig-free pipe lining might conserve you as much as $10,000 in repair expenses, if not more. Set a bucket under the P-trap and disconnect the drainpipes. Then get rid of the sink strainer. Eliminate any excess putty.</p>
