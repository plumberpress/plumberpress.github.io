<p>Polybutylene used inside your home can be discovered near the water heater or coming out of the walls to feed toilets or sinks. Caution: some plumbers set up stub outs" of copper when leaving the wall. Due to the fact that copper is showing does not imply you do not have polybutylene pipes, just. You may need to make a small hole in the drywall to see the connection.</p>
<p>If you do not have a plumber's snake, you can utilize a wire coat hanger by aligning it. Naturally, it will not reach as far as a plumber's snake would, but it may be long enough to reach some blockages. Place it into the kitchen drain or stub pipe to push through or pull out the clog if you can reach it. Take care not to scratch your sink with the wire.</p>
