<h3>Emergency Plumbing Services Decatur AL</h3>
<p>A recently set up hot water heater should not produce unusual noises, but it will start to create rumbling noises as it ages. The sounds get louder gradually as the heater runs to heat up the water. Things get worse dramatically for families with a high demand for hot water. The reasons for the noises can be the buildup of sediments in the tank which need to be flushed to restore normalcy. If the water heater still produces rumbling noises even after it has actually been flushed, a water heater replacement might be essential.</p>
