<p>Form Development: Mold growth is another unfortunate side effect if you need a sewer line fixed. This is most common when you likewise have an odor of sewage along with it. The mold development would probably be behind your walls however will start to seep through in time. You will probably see a white residue on your wall near to an area where a sewer pipe lies.</p>
<p>The typical option is to have the faulty pipes changed when you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes replaced, which is where whole-house repiping is available in. This is an option to think about if you reside in an older home - such as one built pre-1970 - or any home with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular option for home plumbing for many years, however steel eventually suffers from rust and lacks the toughness of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
