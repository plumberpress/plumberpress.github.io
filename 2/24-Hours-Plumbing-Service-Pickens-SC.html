<h3>Warning Signs of Sewer Mainline Pipe Clogs in Pickens SC 29671</h3>
<p>I purchased a "Offer" for $200 toward plumbing services. I have a rental and wished to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and replacing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The written quote to clean 3 sinks and two tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Just one sink drain was even partially clogged. So, since I had a "offer" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (consisting of tax) for the one sink drain. I looked up notes from last time I had the exact sink cleaned from another company and it just cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper only cost $118 + tax) and that was just 9 months back. I feel that rates were increased since I had a "Deal". An Angie's list short article from March stated depending on the marketplace and seriousness of clog, the average cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Embarassment on me for not bringing my past invoice to be sure I wasn't getting rate gouged.</p>
<p>Corrosion: The most typical issue is deterioration in the tank and pipes that connect to your water heater. This is especially true if you have unattended tough water, which contains severe minerals that can connect to the piping and tank and break down the product in time. Whether it's calcium, iron, or another component that is triggering the deterioration, you will ultimately experience a leak in your water heater that is hard to repair. Leaks often indicate a new unit replacement remains in order.</p>
<p>Connection to a Commission water or sewer service connection: This work will be performed by a WSSC Water-licensed Master Plumber. If you follow this simple set of standards, you can help prevent the accumulation of debris. It's the best approach of preserving healthy plumbing and saving money on drain cleaning company.

<p>The EcoWater Compact Series Water Softening System is a compact single tank cabinet" style softener, making it a reliable and hassle-free  system for your home. Friendly, well-informed technician. He got our drain cleared out in a professional and extremely efficient manner. I would not hesitate to call Roto-Rooter for any future needs.
