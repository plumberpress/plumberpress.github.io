<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, but he charged $300 plus tax. Instead of fixing the leak, he wished to replace the whole piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he could not just fix the fittings instead of a total replace. He stated he would change the washers and that might do it. He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted no further repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there considering that it wasn't on a load. As quickly as he left, my renters attempted the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he stated he would not return since he had another visit. An ideal bad plumber story.</p>

<h3>Hour Emergency Plumbing Service Glenolden PA</h3>
<p>Organic particles, such as grease, hair, or food stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is frequently the cause of clogged drains. The most common method a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool known as a plumber's cable television, drain or snake auger. The tool is carefully placed down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can try to do this yourself, but this isn't a newbie's Do It Yourself task. If you utilize the tool improperly, you can damage your pipes and trigger other leaks - so it's worth it to call somebody who understands the drill.</p>
