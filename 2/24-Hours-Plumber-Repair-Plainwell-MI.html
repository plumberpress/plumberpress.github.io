<p>Water that has actually been entirely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is hungry for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have actually been eliminated-- corrosive. For this factor, WQA advises that common metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) must not be used downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not get rid of the TDS and do not trigger this type of rust A softener is merely catching some cations (mainly calcium and magnesium) and launching other cations while doing so (typically salt or often potassium).</p>

The CareSoft ® system was developed with the very same advanced engineering as the Pro and Elite models, with resin that provides high-performance solidity elimination you can depend on for several years to come.</p>
<p>The EcoWater Compact Series Water Softening System is a compact single tank cabinet" style softener, making it a convenient and reliable system for your house. Friendly, well-informed specialist. He got our drain cleared out in a very effective and professional  manner. I would not be reluctant to call Roto-Rooter for any future needs.
