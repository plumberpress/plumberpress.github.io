<h3>Water Filtration Systems in Springfield Kentucky</h2>
<p>Pre-action sprinkler systems usually are installed in areas where water might trigger catastrophic damage, such as in freezers, computer rooms, and areas with electronic equipment. The piping in a pre-action system includes air or nitrogen, which can be pressurized or non-pressurized. Water to the system is held back by the pre-action valve, which is linked to a fire detection system. If a fire takes place, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the pre-action valve, which then enables water into the system's piping. The water is discharged through the open sprinkler.</p>
