<p>When the test results show the repair is total, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was separated throughout the repair process. It is very important that the plumbing system be switched on very slowly to guarantee no damage is done to the piping system. Once the system is pressurized, air must be eliminated from the plumbing system. When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system should be inspected to make sure no valves were accidentally left open or did not close correctly. Once the plumbing system is pressurized, make certain all valves are entirely open and alert the water user that the plumbing system has actually been returned to service.</p>
