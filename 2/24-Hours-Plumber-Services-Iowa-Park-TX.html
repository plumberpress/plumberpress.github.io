We now have actually cleaned up and examined the components parts, replaced the rubber repair parts, re-assembled the parts and the rubber parts back into their components, cleaned the body and the seats and flushed the inbound water line. We are now prepared to start the re-assembly procedure. Some models require the components to be eliminated in a specific order. These assemblies will likewise need the re-assembly in a specific order. Many components can not be re-installed into the body unless the test dicks are left open. As each element is returned into the body, it is very important to put them back in the proper place. It is also essential that as they are put back into the body, that no contaminant is connected on the parts or inadvertently placed in the body. The components must be placed so that the guides are able to preserve their created tolerances.</p>
