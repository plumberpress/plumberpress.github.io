<p>Passive Purge - As much as 2007, some homes were enabled to forego a physical backflow device in lieu of a system where stagnant water was purged from the system with usage of one or more toilets in the home. Typically, the water supply to among the upper floor toilets was piped from the fire lawn sprinkler; upon each usage, fresh water was presented into the fire sprinkler system.</p>
<p>The usual service is to have the defective pipes changed when you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes changed, which is where whole-house repiping can be found in. This is an option to consider if you live in an older home - such as one constructed pre-1970 - or any home with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular choice for home plumbing for numerous years, however steel eventually experiences corrosion and lacks the sturdiness of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
