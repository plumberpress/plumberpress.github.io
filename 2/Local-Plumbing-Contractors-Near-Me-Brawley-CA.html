<p>For shallow pipes without any neighboring utilities or obstructions, digging through and replacing the pipe manually would likely be more affordable than relining it internally. However, if your harmed pipe runs under your driveway, any large trees or pathways, dig-free pipe lining could conserve you as much as $10,000 in repair expenses, if not more. Set a pail under the P-trap and disconnect the drains. Then eliminate the sink strainer. Eliminate any excess putty.</p>
