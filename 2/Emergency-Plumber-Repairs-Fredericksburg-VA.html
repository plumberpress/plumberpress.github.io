<p>When the water does not end up being soft enough, one ought to first think about problems with the salt that is utilized, or mechanical malfunctions of softener parts. When these components are not the reason for the unsatisfactory water softening, it might be time to replace the softener resin, or maybe even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners get rid of the calcium and magnesium ions found in tough water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions. When all the ions are totally exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regeneration process to flush the system of excess ions and charge with new sodium ions.</p>

<p>Have actually used Plumb Crazy on three various occasions, the last including a water line repair for a leak under the cement slab in our home.
