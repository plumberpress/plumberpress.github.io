<p>E.R. Services understands the significance of preserving the stability and efficiency of your kitchen.

<p>Oxidants such as chlorine in the general public water system respond with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, causing them to scale, flake, and become breakable. This leads to micro-fractures and decreases the basic structural integrity of the system. The system becomes weak and may fail without warning, causing damage to the building structure and personal property. Incorrect installation is also a common cause of polybutylene system failure, which can be nearly impossible to discover.</p>
