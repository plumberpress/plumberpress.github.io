<p>Difficult water is brought on by high levels of calcium and magnesium in the water. Water softeners treat the water by using salt and ion-exchange resins to get rid of these minerals.

The resulting soft supply of water is devoid of firmness ions without any other ions being added. Membranes are a kind of water filter needing regular cleaning or replacement maintenance.</p>
