<p>When compared to gas designs, electrical models are easier and more economical to install as electricity is already readily available through the main power supply line. For gas water heaters, a specific gas line needs to be set up and a feasible source of gas established. Another feature of an electrical hot water heater is that they do not require any ventilation. Gas designs need to be aerated properly utilizing vents and ducts in order to function correctly. With electric models, you will not need to install any brand-new vents or ducts in your house.</p>

<p>A cross-connection is any permanent or momentary connection in between a public water system or consumer's potable (i.e., drinking) water system and any source or system containing nonpotable water or other compounds.
