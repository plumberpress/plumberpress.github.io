If scale continues to collect in your pipes, your flow rate will continue to restrict and you risk losing water pressure throughout your home. Hard water ravages water heaters, and without a softener, your energy costs will continue to barrel skyward. If your water supply is hard, the continuous cycle of replacements and repairs will continue up until your home is safeguarded by a water softener.</p>
