<p>If you're dealing with reduced pressure from scale-ridden pipes, dry hair, stiff laundry, and limitless appliance repair expenses, you need a water softener.

If scale continues to collect in your pipes, your flow rate will continue to restrict and you risk losing water pressure throughout your home. Hard water ravages water heaters, and without a softener, your energy costs will continue to barrel skyward. If your water supply is hard, the continuous cycle of replacements and repairs will continue up until your home is safeguarded by a water softener.</p>
