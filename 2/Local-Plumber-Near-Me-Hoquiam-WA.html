<p>When you count on Roto-Rooter for water heater replacement, repair or maintenance, you can anticipate professional service from skilled plumbing professionals. Backflow prevention devices operate by allowing water to stream in only one direction. In an unguarded water service connection, safe and clean water can flow both in and out of a building or component. When water service is disrupted in the street or in a structure for any factor, there is a pressure drop which can draw polluted water backwards into the water system. For example, cleaning fluids may be drawn back from automobile cleans; stagnant water from fire sprinkler systems might enter the drinking waterline; bacteria and pathogens of all sorts can be siphoned back into the water system from air conditioning cooling towers; and chemicals from medical center's X-ray development may flow backwards into the potable water supply. To secure water quality, backflow defense is needed where the end user presents a danger of contaminating the city's water supply.</p>
