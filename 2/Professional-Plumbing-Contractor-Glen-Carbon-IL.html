<h3>Leaky Faucets at Glen Carbon IL 62034 - Renewing Valve Seats and Sealing Stems</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to handle peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively adjust to your business' flow rates throughout the day. During durations of high circulation demand, tanks come on-line to include circulation rate capability. During periods of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This new approach to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation innovation, and it's arguably the most essential development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
