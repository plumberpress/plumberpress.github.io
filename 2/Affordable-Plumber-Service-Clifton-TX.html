<p>Your disposer might feature a thin rubber gasket to be utilized under the sink flange, instead of the standard plumber's putty as detailed below. Both will develop a great seal (though the gasket might result in percentages of water gathering around the flange), and what's utilized is mostly a matter of preference. Some even choose silicone sealant, though it's harder to eliminate.</p>
<p>Remove the old putty with a plastic putty knife so you do not scratch the sink. Seal the brand-new basket in the sink with plumber's putty as shown in Photo 4. Plumber's putty can not be utilized on specific new sinks, but these will be labeled to that result. Use a non-water-based silicone if you can't utilize plumber's putty. When you tighten up the locknut in location, excess putty will squeeze out in between the brand-new basket strainer and the sink. Clean it off with a rag or paper towel. Make certain to place the cardboard friction ring between the rubber gasket and the locknut so the locknut spins freely, without catching on the gasket.</p>

<p>The new inlets and outlets on the tank do not constantly line up with the old supply lines. Solder in a pair of 45-degree fittings to offset each line if essential.

You might need to increase or decrease the vent size to guarantee the best draft. CARE: If you're uncertain if your chimney has a liner, ask your plumbing inspector.</p>
