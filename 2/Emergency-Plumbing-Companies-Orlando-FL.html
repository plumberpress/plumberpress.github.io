Bio-Clean is a natural option that's both safe to your plumbing and remarkably efficient at removing gunk, waste, and organic material that so often clogs up your drain lines. Caustic drain cleaners run along the bottom of your pipes, rusting the sidewalls and just partially fixing the problem. Bio-Clean is an option of live bacteria that actively seek out natural material and eat away at it, developing safe by-products of carbon mineral, dioxide, and water ash, all of which are easily treated at local sewage plants.</p>

Diamond Crystal Â® products attend to specific problems such as iron concentration, rust discolorations and sodium material.
