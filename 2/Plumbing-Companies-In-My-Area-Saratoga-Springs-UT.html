<p>In some homes, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to approach when looking for a viable solution, specifically when easy plunging does not seem to work. However, there are many downsides to utilizing these dangerous products - not least of which is that they generally contain substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is causing an obstruction, which can vary from the typical suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, small things, dirt, and even roots in cases where broken pipes on your home draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them effective, but at the cost of providing the danger of harm to your home and household.</p>
