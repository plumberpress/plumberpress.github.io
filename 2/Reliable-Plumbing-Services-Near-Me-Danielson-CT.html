For a good seal, hold the hose so it aims directly into the shutoff or fill valve while you're screwing on the adapters. Make them handtight, then include another quarter turn with pliers. Connections that are too tight can in fact trigger leakages or spin the fill valve inside the tank. If required, examine for leaks and tighten them a bit more.</p>
