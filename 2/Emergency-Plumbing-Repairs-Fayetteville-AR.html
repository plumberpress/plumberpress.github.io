<p>Camera are one of the most important tools in the plumbing service.

<h3>An Easy Approach To Find A Reliable Plumber Fayetteville AR</h3>
<p>A. Usually wax doesn't "spoil" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to prevent smells. If you are experiencing a leak coming from below the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or full blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Likewise, make sure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" undiscovered issue. If you aren't sure where the leak is coming from, try putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours.</p>
