<h3>Fixing A Clogged Toilet in Galloway OH 43119</h3>
<p>Water that has actually been entirely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is starving for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have been removed-- corrosive. For this reason, WQA advises that typical metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) must not be used downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not get rid of the TDS and do not cause this kind of deterioration A softener is simply capturing some cations (primarily calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations in the process (typically salt or in some cases potassium).</p>
