<h3>Working Consistently With Your Emergency Plumber Friday Harbor WA</h3>
<p>A. Usually wax does not "go bad" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to prevent odors. If you are experiencing a leak coming from below the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or complete blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Likewise, make sure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" undiscovered problem. If you aren't sure where the leak is coming from, attempt putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours.</p>
<p>That is an indicator the tank is failing and will need to be replaced if the water heater is leaking from the bottom of the tank. If it remains in a garage and a little slow leak, schedule a price quote as soon as possible and ensure absolutely nothing is near the heater that could be possibly damaged. Leaking water heaters can burst causing water damage and flooding of homes.</p>
