<p>A water softener has two tanks: a mineral tank and a salt water tank. The mineral tank is where the actual ion exchange, or water softening, takes place. It's filled with small, negatively-charged polystyrene beads called resin or zeolite. The brine tank is where the sodium, or salt, is kept and combined with water. If you plan to drain  your automated dishwasher through your disposer, find the breakout plate inside the inlet port (Image 1). Remove it by carefully punching it with a screwdriver and hammer (Image 2). Leave the breakout plate intact if you will not use your system to drain a dishwasher.</p>

<p>Now wait a minute, some individuals state, does not the water pressure in the water system keep the irrigation water from reversing? Yes, the majority of the time it does. However, there are times when the water pressure drops in the supply system, and this is when the backflow happens. No, it is not a regular occurrence, but it does happen more frequently than you think! When you don't see the water was off for a few minutes, often it takes place at night. An example is when the public utility needs to shut off the water to repair a water pipe, or attach a brand-new pipe. This makes building and construction jobs quickly the most common cause of backflow problems. Fire combating is another typical reason for backflow. Fire trucks utilize big pumps to suck the water out of the fire hydrants. This frequently causes the water pressure in the surrounding locations to drop, and backflow will happen in the surrounding communities.</p>
