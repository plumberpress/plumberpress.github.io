<p>A testable backflow prevention device has 2 check valves-- generally 2 layers of security. The device enables water to push the check valves open when water is entering the structure, but closes them shut when water tries to go the wrong method. There are two various kinds of testable backflow prevention devices that are typically specified-- a decreased pressure zone backflow device and a double check backflow device. There are a couple of others that I will point out but do not get hung up on them. I discuss them just due to the fact that they will be on a certification test.</p>

The tool is carefully placed down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can try to do this yourself, however this isn't a newbie's Do It Yourself task.
