<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one must first think about problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical breakdowns of softener elements. When these components are not the reason for the unacceptable water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or possibly even the entire softener. Cation exchange water softeners eliminate the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in difficult water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. Once all the ions are totally exchanged, the water softener goes through a regeneration procedure to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with brand-new salt ions.</p>
