<p>Examining the water meter is an excellent next action in your plumbing inspection. Close all faucets and examine if the water meter is turning. If it is, there is a leak someplace and this could be major issue. Proceed to the valves. Start with the main shut off valve operation. When shut down, no faucet in your house need to have water. This chooses every other shut down valve and their corresponding faucets. If whatever is working appropriately, you are off to an excellent start.</p>

<h3>Unclog Drains, Toilets and Sewers With The Help of in Dequincy LA 70633 Plumbers</h3>
<p>I purchased a "Deal" for $200 toward plumbing services. I have a rental and wanted to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and changing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The composed estimate to clean 3 sinks and 2 tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Only one sink drain was even partially clogged. So, because I had a "deal" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (including tax) for the one sink drain. I searched for notes from last time I had the specific sink cleaned up from another company and it only cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper only cost $118 + tax) and that was just 9 months ago. I feel that rates were increased due to the fact that I had a "Offer". An Angie's list post from March said depending upon the market and severity of clog, the average cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Embarassment on me for not bringing my past invoice to be sure I wasn't getting rate gouged.</p>
