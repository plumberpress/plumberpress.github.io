When utilized in the context of a fire lawn sprinkler, a backflow preventer device is utilized to guarantee that water does not flow from the sprinkler system back into the municipal supply of water, or other source of drinking water. Unfortunately, water held in the sprinkler system can end up being contaminated. If allowed to return to the supply of water, there is potential for the polluted water to end up being a health risk. The backflow preventer is intended to prevent water flowing back towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be examined regularly for effectiveness, in addition to checked yearly by a fire inspection company in order to ensure they are working as they should.</p>
