<h3>How To Repair Your Water Heater in Lees Summit MO 64081</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Instead of a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to handle peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively get used to your service' circulation rates throughout the day. During periods of high flow need, tanks come on-line to add flow rate capacity. Throughout durations of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This new technique to softening is called progressive or responsive flow technology, and it's perhaps the most crucial development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
