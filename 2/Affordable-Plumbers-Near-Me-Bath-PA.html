<h3>Types Of Blocked Drain Cleaning Equipment in Bath PA 18014</h3>
<p>Your home's drainage works by the simple force of gravity. When you flush water and waste down your sink or shower (and your toilets also) it's not really the flow of water pushing them down your pipes. Rather, once they go down your drain, gravity takes over as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a downward angle to the sewer line. When something obstructs the pipes, anything you put down there will not go through.</p>
