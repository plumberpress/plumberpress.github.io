<p>The easiest way to keep you and your family safe from the potential risks of backflow through cross connections is to not produce cross connections in the first place.

You may have a leak someplace if you've been seeing a moldy odor establishing in the cabinets under the sink. It might be the drain, the faucet, or perhaps the supply hose. Since they are relatively simple to identify, turn on the water and get snooping under your sink.</p>
<p>A review of the hydraulic conditions present at the assembly should then be evaluated. There are hydraulic conditions such as pressure variations and disc compression that could result in incorrect data on the functions of the backflow prevention assembly. Hydraulic conditions such as water hammer can cause extreme pressure spikes that could damage parts. The effects of elevated temperature can likewise cause excessive pressure conditions which could harm the parts in the components. These and other negative effects from the hydraulic conditions must be recognized and their cause corrected. The new parts can soon be made inoperative if parts are changed and the hydraulic conditions are not remedied.</p>
