Also replace the old shutoff valve with a brand-new ball valve while you're at it (Picture 6). Vent diameters are sized according to the heat output of the water heater. You may have to increase or reduce the vent size to ensure the best draft. CARE: If you're uncertain if your chimney has a liner, ask your plumbing inspector.</p>
