The per hour charge for a plumbing contractor is $72 to $82, which does not include materials or parts. Costs depend upon the precise repair needed, where you live, working with a plumber vs. working with a handyman, and whether or not you can DIY it.</p>
<p>You count on your drains to carry wastewater from your shower, sink or tub. Gradually, the drains end up being clogged with residue such as mineral sediment, food, hair, grease and more. These materials collect in the drain and ultimately harden versus the pipe walls, making them difficult to get rid of.
