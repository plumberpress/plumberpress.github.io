<p>Once the hardware parts have been cleaned up and examined and the rubber parts have actually been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their parts. Some parts may have extremely tight tolerances that need to be preserved. A crucial thing to determine on each component is the guide.

If the component is not repaired correctly, the guide could restrict the motion (rather than stable or direct) of the part, which could cause the part to not work to its capabilities. Many times springs are incorrectly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In most cases the guides are limiting the travel of the element triggering lower test results than what is required.</p>
