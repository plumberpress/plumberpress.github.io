<h3>Is Your Water Heater Leaking? Find Out What You Should Do in Jay OK 74346</h3>
<p>Water that has actually been completely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is hungry for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have been removed-- corrosive.

Softeners do not get rid of the TDS and do not cause this type of rust A softener is simply catching some cations (primarily calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations at the same time (typically salt or often potassium).</p>
