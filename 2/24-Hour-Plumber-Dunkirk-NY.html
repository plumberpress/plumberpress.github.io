<p>When you get rid of the cap to flush out the valve, examine the washer for wear or fractures. Replacing a bad washer is low-cost and easy. But finding the ideal washer may not be. The most typical washers are often readily available at home centers and hardware stores. Other styles can be hard to discover. Remove it and take it to the shop to find a match if you choose to hunt for a washer. Plumbers typically replace the whole fill valve rather than hunt for a replacement washer.</p>
<p>From beneath the sink, position a rubber gasket and metal or fiber friction ring over the strainer. Secure the gasket and friction ring by screwing on the drain locking ring. Next, make certain the drain compression seal is seated properly in the drain locknut, then re-install and tighten up the drain locknut. Finally, switch on the water and test for leakages.</p>
