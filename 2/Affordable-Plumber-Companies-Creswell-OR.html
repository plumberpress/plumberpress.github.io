When utilized in the context of a fire sprinkler system, a backflow preventer device is used to ensure that water does not stream from the lawn sprinkler back into the municipal water supply, or other source of drinking water. Sadly, water held in the lawn sprinkler can become infected. If enabled to return to the water supply, there is potential for the infected water to end up being a health risk. The backflow preventer is meant to avoid water receding towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be inspected regularly for efficiency, as well as examined annually by a fire inspection company in order to ensure they are working as they should.</p>
