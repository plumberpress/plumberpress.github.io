<p>These branching circulation pipelines form loops and networks consisting of water mains and supply pipelines. Water mains range in size from 6 inches, to 8, 10, 12, and 16 inches in diameter. The pipelines provide water for entire neighborhoods as well as large commercial, industrial and residential complexes. Depending upon the flow capability, location and age of the pipe system, these pipelines are made from a range of materials: polyvinyl chloride (PVC), high density polyethylene (HDPE), cast iron, ductile iron, copper, steel, asbestos cement, and even smaller-diameter strengthened concrete.</p>
<p>The most basic mechanical backflow prevention device is the vacuum breaker assembly (VBA). It has one moving part, a portable disc attached to an atmospheric vent. In case of a siphon, the pressure in the valve will drop below that of the outdoors air. This sets off the disc to open, allowing air to bring back and get in the valve pressure equivalent to ambient climatic requirement. This restoration of pressure breaks the siphon and prevents cross contamination.</p>
