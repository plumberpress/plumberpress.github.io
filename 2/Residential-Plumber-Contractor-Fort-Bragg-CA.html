<p>There are certain plumbers who focus on plumbing connected with home improvement and new construction. When a new house is built, water pipes need to be run, and toilets, sinks and faucets need to be set up properly and to local, state, and federal code. While your go-to plumber might be a great candidate for unclogging your toilet, a more specialized plumber needs to be utilized for home redesigning work.</p>
<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, however he charged $300 plus tax. Instead of fixing the leak, he wanted to replace the entire piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he could not just fix the fittings instead of a total replace. He stated he would change the washers which might do it. He then disconnected the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he left with no further repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there considering that it wasn't on a load. As quickly as he left, my renters tried the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he stated he would not return due to the fact that he had another appointment. A best bad plumber story.</p>
