<p>These valves have a lot of flexibility. They're the least expensive of the backflow prevention alternatives, however they also supply the least amount of security. A climatic vacuum breaker, likewise known as an anti-siphon valve, stops back siphonage with a floating disc. When pressurized and drops to permit air to go into the downstream piping when depressurized, this disc seals and rises off the air inlet.</p>
