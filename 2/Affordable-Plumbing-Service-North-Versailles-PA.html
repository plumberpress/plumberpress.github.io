It is important that the plumbing system be switched on extremely gradually to guarantee no damage is done to the piping system. As soon as the system is pressurized, air should be gotten rid of from the plumbing system. Each outlet on the plumbing system need to be checked to ensure no valves were mistakenly exposed or did not close effectively when re-pressurized. When the plumbing system is pressurized, be sure all valves are totally open and notify the water user that the plumbing system has been returned to service.</p>
<p>Noticing high water pressure at plumbing fixtures in your house? Water pressure in the house is similar to high blood pressure in the body - it needs to be controlled to keep the system healthy.
