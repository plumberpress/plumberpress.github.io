<p>How does ion exchange work? A physical and chemical  procedure filters the water through an exchange media referred to as resin or zeolite. Generally, the resin is a artificial or natural , sand-like product coated with positively charged salt ions. As the calcium and magnesium liquifies into positively charged ions, an ion exchange environment is produced. The water streams through the unit while the resin releases its sodium ions and easily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water flowing out of the device is now thought about soft.</p>
<p>In the typical repair, the old rubber parts must be removed and replaced with brand-new rubber parts. When putting the backflow prevention assembly back together whether they are hardware or rubber parts, it is important that just original factory repair parts are used. The rubber parts the maker produces for the assembly are the only ones the assembly was created to use and altering the rubber from the initial factory parts will impact the operation of the backflow prevention assembly and void any approvals.</p>
