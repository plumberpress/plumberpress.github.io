<p>Passive Purge - Up to 2007, some houses were allowed to forego a physical backflow device in lieu of a system where stagnant water was purged from the system with use of one or more toilets in the home. Usually, the water supply to one of the upper floor toilets was piped from the fire sprinkler system; upon each usage, fresh water was introduced into the fire sprinkler system.</p>
<p>For shallow pipes with no close-by energies or obstructions, digging through and replacing the pipe by hand would likely be more affordable than relining it internally. However, if your harmed pipe runs under your driveway, any large trees or walkways, dig-free pipe lining might conserve you as much as $10,000 in repair costs, if not more. Set a pail under the P-trap and disconnect the drainpipes. Then get rid of the sink strainer. Get rid of any excess putty.</p>
