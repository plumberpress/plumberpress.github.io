<p>In the 1990 â€² s, drought conditions determined water service providers to carry out water conservation programs in California. In these programs, older 3.5 and 6.0 - gallons per flush toilet fixtures in houses were replaced with 1.6 - gallons per flush designs. Constant obstructions: If the plunger has actually ended up being a routine component in your bathroom, it's time for a replacement. Continuous clogs show your toilet no longer has the power needed to efficiently remove waste with each flush.</p>

These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is triggering a clog, which can vary from the usual suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, small objects, dirt, and even roots in cases where split pipes on your residential or commercial property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them effective, however at the cost of presenting the danger of harm to your home and family.</p>
