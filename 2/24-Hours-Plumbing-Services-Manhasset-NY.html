WaterBoss water softener systems include a whole home water filtration with its patented self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the liquified rock and dirt and sediment are sent out down the drain. With the resin beads charged," the water softener returns to service, supplying the whole home with clean, soft water.</p>
