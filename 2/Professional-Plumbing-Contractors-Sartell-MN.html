Hard water destroys home appliances, leaves cloudy soap residue throughout cooking areas and restrooms, and dries out hair and skin. With over 85% of the United States relying on tough water for their cleaning, bathing, and cooking, water softeners serve an essential purpose. A water softener saves you from changing too soon ruined water heaters, scaly faucet heads, and hours and hours of cleaning up soapy residue. Purchasing a water softener conserves you time, money, and energy, and safeguards your home and your property.</p>
<p>Inspecting the water meter is a fantastic next step in your plumbing inspection. If the water meter is turning, close all faucets and check. There is a leak someplace and this might be serious issue if it is. Proceed to the valves. Start with the main turned off valve operation. When shut off, no faucet in your home should have water. This opts for every other shut off valve and their matching faucets. You are off to a great start if everything is working appropriately.</p>
