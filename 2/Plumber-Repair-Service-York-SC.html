<h3>Necessity of Sewer Line Inspection in York SC 29745 and Its Procedures</h3>
<p>I acquired a "Deal" for $200 towards plumbing services. I have a rental and wished to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and changing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The written price quote to clean 3 sinks and 2 tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Just one sink drain was even partially clogged. So, given that I had a "offer" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (including tax) for the one sink drain. I looked up notes from last time I had the exact sink cleaned up from another company and it only cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper just cost $118 + tax) and that was just 9 months ago. I feel that prices were increased since I had a "Deal". An Angie's list short article from March said depending on the market and severity of clog, the average cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Shame on me for not bringing my previous receipt to be sure I wasn't getting price gouged.</p>

<p>A cross-connection is any short-lived or long-term connection in between a public water system or customer's drinkable (i.e., drinking) water supply and any source or system including nonpotable water or other substances. An example is the piping between a public water system or consumer's safe and clean water supply and an auxiliary water system, cooling system or irrigation system.</p>
