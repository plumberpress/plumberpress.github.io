Run cold water while running the disposal and you can depend on clear pipes and fresh smelling drains. Explore our water softener collection and delight in better water for bathing and home appliances.</p>
<p>Retail prices for house water softeners might vary from approximately $400 to $2,700, depending upon the size and type of softener. Softeners are rated by the overall number of grains the system can eliminate before being recharged.
