If you choose to hunt for a washer, remove it and take it to the store to discover a match. Plumbers usually replace the whole fill valve instead of hunt for a replacement washer.</p>
<p>Setting up a brand-new gas line in the kitchen will generally range from $300 to $800 depending on the length of the pipe needed.
