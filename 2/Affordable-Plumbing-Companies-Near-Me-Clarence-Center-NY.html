It is important that the plumbing system be turned on extremely gradually to ensure no damage is done to the piping system. Once the system is pressurized, air should be gotten rid of from the plumbing system. When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system must be inspected to make sure no valves were accidentally left open or did not close properly. Once the plumbing system is pressurized, make sure all valves are entirely open and alert the water user that the plumbing system has actually been gone back to service.</p>
