<p>Have used Plumb Crazy on three different events, the last involving a water line repair for a leak under the cement slab in our house. Billy and Hector were our professionals and they were wonderful. They rapidly discovered the leak and repaired it without making a substantial mess. They, as with everyone we have actually encountered with Plumb Crazy, were polite, timely, and extremely educated. I would recommend Plumb Crazy to anyone needing either small or large job plumbing work.</p>
