<p>Water hardness is the amount of liquified calcium and magnesium in the water-- tough water is high in both calcium and magnesium. The reason you can feel the distinction on your skin is due to the fact that soap responds with the calcium to form soap scum. This results in the need for more soap or detergent to get things clean.
