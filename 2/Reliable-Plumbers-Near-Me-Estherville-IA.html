<p>Plastic pipe is in wide use for domestic supply of water and drain-waste-vent (DWV) pipe. Principal types consist of: Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) was produced experimentally in the 19th century but did not end up being practical to manufacture until 1926, when Waldo Semon of BF Goodrich Co. developed an approach to plasticize PVC, making it easier to process. PVC pipe started to be produced in the 1940s and was in large usage for Drain-Waste-Vent piping throughout the reconstruction of Germany and Japan following WWII. In the 1950s, plastics producers in Western Europe and Japan began producing acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) pipe. The method for producing cross-linked polyethylene (PEX) was likewise developed in the 1950s. Plastic supply pipes have become progressively typical, with a range of fittings and materials employed.</p>
<p>The usual service is to have the defective pipes changed when you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes. Nevertheless, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes replaced, which is where whole-house repiping is available in. This is an alternative to think about if you live in an older home - such as one constructed pre-1970 - or any home with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular option for home plumbing for many years, but steel ultimately struggles with corrosion and lacks the toughness of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
