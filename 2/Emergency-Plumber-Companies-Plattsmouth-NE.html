<p>These valves have a lot of versatility. They're the least costly of the backflow prevention options, however they likewise offer the least quantity of security. A climatic vacuum breaker, also referred to as an anti-siphon valve, stops back siphonage with a drifting disc. This disc seals and rises off the air inlet when pressurized and drops to enable air to go into the downstream piping when depressurized.</p>
<p>Responsive circulation technology works by constantly bringing tanks off-line and online in response to the water demands of your carwash. For example, in a four-tank MTS setup with responsive circulation technology, only one of the 4 tanks is needed to soften water when the carwash isn't hectic. However, more tanks come online as the wash bays fill. This responsive design allows the MTS to consume to 50% less salt and 38% less regeneration water than conventional single-tank or twin alternating systems.</p>
