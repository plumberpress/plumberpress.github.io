<p>Your sewer line is one of the most important parts of your household plumbing - and if it ends up being broken or clogged, it might wreak unwanted issues on your home.

In many cases, the property owner is responsible for maintaining the service line from the home to the curb, and the City is responsible for maintaining the mainline sewer and the part of the service line from the mainline sewer to the curb.</p>
<p>When they are caught in a timely style, keep in mind that the majority of plumbing problems are simple for a professional to fix. Make a visit to have a plumber diagnose the issue if you are experiencing any of the above signs in your household. The earlier you fix plumbing problems, the less costly the repairs.
