<h3>Plumbing, Drains & Water Cleanup Castaic CA</h3>
<p>Professional drain cleaning and plumbing stoppage service might appear like a waste of cash. Why buy professional drain repair service when a chemical drain cleaner will suffice? While chemical drain cleaners might be an inexpensive option, the harsh active ingredients corrode your inner drain pipe, over time, creating weak points in the pipe that are likely to rupture. Dealing with repairing a burst pipe is definitely not worth the cost savings incurred from utilizing a chemical drain cleaner.</p>
<p>A backflow preventer is a method or system to avoid backflow. The fundamental means of avoiding backflow is an air gap, which either eliminates a cross-connection or provides a barrier to backflow.

The primary kinds of mechanical backflow preventer are the reduced-pressure principle assembly, the pressure vacuum breaker assembly, and the check valve assembly. A secondary kind of mechanical backflow preventer is the residential dual check valve.</p>
