<p>How does ion exchange work? A chemical and physical process filters the water through an exchange media known as resin or zeolite. Normally, the resin is a natural or artificial, sand-like product covered with positively charged sodium ions. As the calcium and magnesium dissolves into positively charged ions, an ion exchange environment is developed. The water streams through the system while the resin launches its sodium ions and readily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water flowing out of the device is now thought about soft.</p>
<p>Reverse osmosis utilizes an applied pressure gradient throughout a semi permeable membrane to overcome osmotic pressure and eliminate water molecules from the solution with solidity ions. The membrane has pores large enough to admit water particles for passage; solidity ions such as Ca2+ and Mg2+ will not fit through the pores. The resulting soft water system is devoid of hardness ions without any other ions being included. Membranes are a kind of water filter requiring regular cleaning or replacement maintenance.</p>
