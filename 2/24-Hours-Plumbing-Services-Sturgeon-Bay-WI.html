<p>Your sewer line is among the most vital parts of your household plumbing - and if it becomes clogged or damaged, it could wreak undesirable concerns on your property. A house's service line (likewise known as a sewer lateral) runs from your home to the mainline sewer in the street. In most cases, the property owner is responsible for maintaining the service line from the house to the curb, and the City is responsible for preserving the mainline sewer and the part of the service line from the mainline sewer to the curb.</p>

Roto-Rooter has the experience and mechanical ability to totally clean such commercial roof drains to bring back full drainage to the system.</p>
