<p>In water supply systems, water is generally preserved at a considerable pressure to make it possible for water to flow from the tap, shower, or other component. Water pressure may fail or be reduced when a water pipe bursts, pipes freeze, or there is an all of a sudden high demand on the water supply (for instance, when a number of fire hydrants are opened). Decreased pressure in the pipe may allow contaminated water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be drawn up into the system.</p>
