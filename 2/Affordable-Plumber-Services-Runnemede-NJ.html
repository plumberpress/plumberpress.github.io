<p>CPM Plumbing concentrates on quick service, precise troubleshooting, and precision repairs so your service never needs to experience downtime. One thing to understand about gas lines is they can be incredibly dangerous if there is a leak. While gas leaks are uncommon, you need to get out of the structure right away if you notice a smell like rotten eggs in your home. A gas leak can have nearly immediate results on those exposed to it, and it can even be fatal. If you have actually got a gas pipe leaking, get out of your home and call us immediately.</p>
<p>Our licensed plumbing technicians can do this for you, or you can do it yourself by connecting a hose to drain the tank to an appropriate drain. Flushing the water heating tank must be done 2x every year. So, while a chemical drain cleaner may provide a fast fix in the short term, it can cause far more problems, damage, and headaches in the long run.

<p>There's an excellent chance it's since the garbage disposal is clogged if the sink is no longer draining pipes as quickly as it when did.
