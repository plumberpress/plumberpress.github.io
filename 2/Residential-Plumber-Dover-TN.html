<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Instead of a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to handle peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to effectively adapt to your service' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high flow demand, tanks come on-line to add circulation rate capability. During periods of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This brand-new technique to softening is called progressive or responsive flow technology, and it's probably the most essential development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
