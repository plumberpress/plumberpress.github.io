<p>Waste Disposal Unit Installation Fed Up With False Promises? Bad Odors - If foul odors are emerging from your drain, this is a clear indication your sink is not correctly draining water. Undesirable smells are a direct result of waste-build up in your drain piping. When this build-up collects, it can result in stronger odors, and more extreme piping concerns. Without functional draining pipes, excessive pressure can cause your piping system to break and leak leading to expensive water damage.</p>
<p>A backflow preventer is a way or system to prevent backflow. The fundamental ways of preventing backflow is an air space, which either removes a cross-connection or provides a barrier to backflow. The fundamental system for avoiding backflow is a mechanical backflow preventer, which provides a physical barrier to backflow. The principal types of mechanical backflow preventers are the reduced-pressure concept assembly, the pressure vacuum breaker assembly, and the double check valve assembly.</p>
