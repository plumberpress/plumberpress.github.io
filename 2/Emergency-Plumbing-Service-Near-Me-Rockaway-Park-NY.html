Generally constructed of large-diameter (10 feet or more) reinforced concrete pipe sectors, and even tunnels lined with an impermeable coating, these are huge underground and aboveground pipes created to bring bulk circulation amounts of water to treatment plants, secondary storage centers and distribution nodes where the circulations are moved to smaller-sized branch distribution pipelines.
