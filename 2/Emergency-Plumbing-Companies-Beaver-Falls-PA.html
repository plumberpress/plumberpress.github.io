In these programs, older 3.5 and 6.0 - gallons per flush toilet components in homes were changed with 1.6 - gallons per flush designs. Constant obstructions: If the plunger has become a regular fixture in your bathroom, it's time for a replacement. Constant blockages show your toilet no longer has actually the power required to efficiently get rid of waste with each flush.</p>
