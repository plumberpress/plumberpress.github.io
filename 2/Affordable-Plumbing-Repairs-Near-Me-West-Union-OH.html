When you do not notice the water was off for a couple of minutes, often it happens at night. An example is when the water company has to shut off the water to repair a pipes, or attach a brand-new pipe. This makes building and construction projects easily the most common cause of backflow problems. Fire fighting is another common cause of backflow.
